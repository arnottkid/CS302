</UL>

The priority queue data structure maintains a collection of items with fast access to the minimum.
Its API supports the following operations:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>Push(v)</b> adds a value to the Priority Queue.
<LI> <b>Pop()</b> removes the minimum value from the Priority Queue and returns it to the caller.
</UL>
<P>

In <b><a href=include/pqueue.hpp>include/pqueue.hpp</a></b>, I define an interface for a priority
queue which holds doubles.  Then I define  class definitions for two implementations:

<UL>
<LI> <b>PQueueSet</b> implements the priority queue with a multiset.
<LI> <b>PQueueHeap</b> implements the priority queue with a binary heap (which I'll
     be explaining below):
</UL>

As you can see, I've added a few useful methods -- <b>Size()</b>,
<b>Empty()</b> and
<b>Print()</b> -- 
to the interface.

#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;

<font color=blue>/* The Main Priority Queue Interface. */</font>

class PQueue {
  public:
    virtual ~PQueue() {};
    virtual void    Push(double d) = 0;
    virtual double  Pop()          = 0;
    virtual size_t  Size() const   = 0;
    virtual bool    Empty() const  = 0;
    virtual void    Print() const  = 0;
};
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>

   queue with a multiset */</font>

class PQueueSet : public PQueue {
  public:
    void    Push(double d);
    double  Pop();
    size_t  Size() const;
    bool    Empty() const;
    void    Print() const;

    PQueueSet();
  protected:
    std::multiset &lt;double&gt; elements;
};
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=blue>/* PQueueHeap: Implementing the priority 
   queue with a binary heap.  You'll note
   that there is a second constructor
   here that creates the priority queue
   from a vector of doubles. */</font>

class PQueueHeap : public PQueue {
  public:
    void    Push(double d);
    double  Pop();
    size_t  Size() const;
    bool    Empty() const;
    void    Print() const;

    PQueueHeap();
    PQueueHeap(const std::vector &lt;double&gt; &init);
  protected:
    std::vector &lt;double&gt; h;
    void Percolate_Down(size_t index);
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You'll note that there is an extra constructor in the heap implementation.
This is a constructor that creates a priority queue from an unsorted
vector of doubles.  We'll discuss that more below.

<h3>The multiset implementation</h3>

The easiest way to implement a priority queue is to use a <b>multiset</b>.  This implementation 
is so simple that most methods take one line of code.  It is in 
<b><a href=src/pqueue_set.cpp>src/pqueue_set.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include "pqueue.hpp"
using namespace std;

<font color=blue>/* Using a multiset to implement the priority queue makes 
   most of these methods really simple.  The first four
   here are one-liners: */</font>

        PQueueSet::PQueueSet()    { }
void    PQueueSet::Push(double d) { elements.insert(d); }
size_t  PQueueSet::Size() const   { return elements.size(); }
bool    PQueueSet::Empty() const  { return elements.empty(); }

<font color=blue>/* Print() is straightfoward. */</font>

void PQueueSet::Print() const
{
  multiset &lt;double&gt;::const_iterator hit;

  for (hit = elements.begin(); hit != elements.end(); hit++) {
    if (hit != elements.begin()) cout &lt;&lt; " ";
    cout &lt;&lt; *hit;
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=blue>/* With Pop(), we error check, and then if the multiset
   is not empty, we return the first element, and erase
   it from the multiset. */</font>

double PQueueSet::Pop() 
{
  multiset &lt;double&gt;::iterator hit;
  double retval;
  
  if (elements.empty()) {
    throw (string) "Called Pop() on an empty PQueue";
  }
  hit = elements.begin();
  retval = *hit;
  elements.erase(hit);
  return retval;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>


To test, I have written two simple programs that use Priority Queues.  The 
first is
<b><a href=src/add_5.cpp>src/add_5.cpp</a></b>.  It creates an insteance of the PQueue
and then prompts the user for five numbers.  It pushes them onto the priority
queue and then prints the queue.  It reads its command line argument to determine
whether to use the multiset implementation ('s') or the heap implementation ('h').

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include "pqueue.hpp"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  PQueue *pq;
  int i;
  double d;

  <font color=blue>/* Construct the proper implementation of the priority queue. */</font>

  if (argc != 2 || (argv[1][0] != 's' && argv[1][0] != 'h')) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: add_5 s|h\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  switch (argv[1][0]) { 
    case 's': pq = new PQueueSet(); break;
    case 'h': pq = new PQueueHeap(); break;
    default:  exit(1);
  }
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
  <font color=blue>/* Prompt for five numbers.
     Push them and print the PQueue. */</font>

  cout &lt;&lt; "Enter five numbers.\n";

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    if (!(cin &gt;&gt; d)) exit(1);
    pq-&gt;Push(d);
  }
  pq-&gt;Print();
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When we run <b>bin/add_5</b> on the multiset implementation, the numbers are sorted,
because the multiset sorts them:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/add_5 s</b></font>
Enter five numbers.
<font color=darkred><b>3 5 2 4 1</b></font>
1 2 3 4 5
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The second program is 
<b><a href=src/pq_sort.cpp>src/pq_sort.cpp</a></b>.  This program reads doubles from
standard input and sorts them using a priority queue.  Like <b>bin/add_5</b> it uses
its command line argument to determine which implementation to use:

<UL>
<LI> 'c' uses the multiset implementation.
<LI> 'h' uses the heap implementation, but pushes each value onto the heap.
<LI> 'l' uses the heap implementation, but pushes each value onto a vector, and 
     then after reading all of the values, it calls the constructor on the vector.
</UL>

After reading in the values, it pops them all, printing them out as it pops them.  That
prints the values in sorted order.  Take a look at the code to error check -- it's
a useful trick when you want to check whether a value belongs to a set of characters:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include "pqueue.hpp"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  PQueue *pq;
  double d;
  string imps;
  vector &lt;double&gt; v;

  <font color=blue>/* Error check, and then create the pq with either the set or heap implementation. */</font>

  imps = "shl";
  if (argc != 2 || imps.find(argv[1][0]) == string::npos) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: pqueue_sort c where c is a character in %s\n", imps.c_str());
    exit(1);
  }

  switch (argv[1][0]) { 
    case 's': pq = new PQueueSet(); break;
    case 'h': pq = new PQueueHeap(); break;
    case 'l': pq = NULL; break;
    default:  exit(1);
  }

  <font color=blue>/* With 's' and 'h', simply read and push onto the heap.  With 'l', read everything
     into a vector and then construct the heap from the vector. */</font>

  if (pq == NULL) {
    while (cin &gt;&gt; d) v.push_back(d);
    pq = new PQueueHeap(v);
  } else {
    while (cin &gt;&gt; d) pq-&gt;Push(d);
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Popping everything sorts the doubles. */</font>

  while (!pq-&gt;Empty()) cout &lt;&lt; pq-&gt;Pop() &lt;&lt; endl;

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Let's test it on the multiset:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 5 txt/input.txt</b></font>
782.678
270.576
447.465
501.138
714.567
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 5 txt/input.txt | bin/pq_sort s</b></font>
270.576

501.138
714.567
782.678
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>wc txt/input.txt</b></font>
    1000    1000    7885 txt/input.txt
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/pq_sort s < txt/input.txt > txt/output1.txt</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sort -n input.txt > txt/output2.txt</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>diff txt/output1.txt txt/output2.txt</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Now, time to learn about binary heaps:

<hr>
<h3>Implementing the priority queue with a binary heap</h3>

Typically, one implements a priority queue with a data structure called a <i>binary heap</i>
(or simply <i>heap</i> for short).
A heap is a "complete binary tree" -- which means it is a tree where every level is full,
except for the last.  The last level fills up from the left to the right.
Thus, if we know how many elements are in a heap, we know exactly what it looks like.
For example, a heap with 10 elements will look as follows, regardless of the values of
the elements.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><img src=img/Heap-10.png></td></table></center><p>

The other property of a heap is that the value of each node must be less than or equal to all of
the values in its subtrees.  That's it.  Below are two examples of heaps:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td valign=top><img src=img/Good-Heap-1.png></td>
<td valign=top><img src=img/Good-Heap-2.png></td>
</table></center><p>

That second one has duplicate values (two sixes), but that's ok.  It still fits the definition of a heap.
<p>
Below are three examples of non-heaps:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Bad-Heap-1.png><br>The 10 node is not smaller than the values in its subtrees.</td>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Bad-Heap-2.png><br>Not a complete tree.</td>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Bad-Heap-3.png><br>The last row is not filled from left to right.</td>
</table></center><p>

When we push a value onto a heap, we know where the new node is going to go.  So we insert the
value there.  Unfortunately, that may not result in a new heap, so we adjust the heap by "percolating up."
To percolate up, we look at the value's parent.  If the parent is smaller than the value, then we can
quit -- we have a valid heap.  Otherwise, we swap the value with its parent, and continue percolating up.
<p>
Below we give an example of inserting the value 2 into a heap:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><tr>
<td valign=top align=center><u>Start</u><p><img src=img/Insert-Ex-1.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center><u>Put 2 into the new node and percolate up.</u><p><img src=img/Insert-Ex-2.png></td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign=top align=center><u>Continue percolating, since 2 is less than 3.</u><p><img src=img/Insert-Ex-3.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center><u>Now we stop, since 1 is less than 2.</u><p><img src=img/Insert-Ex-4.png></td></tr>
</table></center><p>

To pop a value off a heap, again, we know the shape of the tree when we're done -- we will lose the rightmost node
on the last level. So what we do is put the value in that node into the root (we will return the old value of the
root as the return value of the <b>Pop()</b> call).
Of course, we may not be left with a heap, so as in the previous example, we must modify the heap.  We do that
by "Percolating Down."  This is a little more complex than percolating up.  To percolate down, we check a value
against its children.  If it is the smallest of the three, then we're done.  Otherwise, we swap it with the child
that has the minimum value, and continue percolating down.  
<p>
As before, an example helps.  We will call <b>Pop()</b> on the last heap above.  This will return 1 to the user,
and will delete the node holding the 7, so we put the value 7 into the root and start percolating down:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><tr>
<td valign=top align=center><u>Start</u><p><img src=img/Pop-Ex-1.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center><u>Swap 7 and 2</u><p><img src=img/Pop-Ex-2.png></td>
</tr><tr>
<td valign=top align=center><u>Swap 7 and 3.  We're Done.</u><p><img src=img/Pop-Ex-3.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center></td></tr>
</table></center><p>

If we think about running time complexity, obviously the depth of a heap with <i>n</i> elements is <i>log<sub>2</sub>(n)</i>.
Thus, <b>Push()</b> and <b>Pop()</b> both run with <i>O(log(n))</i> complexity.  This is the exact same as using 
a multiset above.  So why do we bother?
<p>
The answer is that even though the two have the same running time complexity, the heap implementation is more
efficient.  Since we always add and subtract elements to and from the end of the heap, we may implement the heap
as a vector.  The root is at index 0, the nodes at the next level are at indices 1 and 2, etc.  For example,
we show how the final heap above maps to a vector:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><tr>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Linearize-1.png></td>
<td valign=center align=center><img src=img/Linearize-2.png></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

When we <b>Push()</b> an element onto the heap, we perform a <b>push_back()</b> on the vector, and then we 
percolate up.  When we <b>Pop()</b> an element off the heap, we store the root, replace it with the last
element, call <b>pop_back()</b> on the vector, and percolate down starting at the root.
A quick inspection of the indices shows that:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> We can find element <i>i</i>'s left child at index <i>i*2+1</i>.
<LI> We can find element <i>i</i>'s right child at index <i>i*2+2</i>.
<LI> We can find element <i>i</i>'s parent at index <i>(i-1)/2</i> - that uses integer division.
</UL>

Because we use a vector rather than a linked data structure (like a red-black tree or AVL tree, which is
how the STL implements maps and sets), the operations should be more efficient than using the multiset
implementation.

<hr>
<h3>The Heap Implementation</h3>

The heap implementation is in 
<b><a href=src/pqueue_heap.cpp>src/pqueue_heap.cpp</a></b>.  The vector that 
implements the heap is named <b>h</b>.  Below, I show <b>Push()</b>,
which appends the element to the vector and then percolates up:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* With Push(), we append the new element to the
   end of the vector, and then percolate up. */</font>

void PQueueHeap::Push(double d) 
{ 
  int i, parent;
  double tmp;

  <font color=blue>/* Put the element at the end of the vector. */</font>

  h.push_back(d);

  <font color=blue>/* And then percolate up.  i is always
     pointing to the newly added element. */</font>

  i = h.size()-1;
  while (1) {
    if (i == 0) return;
    parent = (i-1)/2;
    if (h[parent] &gt; h[i]) {
      tmp = h[i];
      h[i] = h[parent];
      h[parent] = tmp;
      i = parent;
    } else {
      return;
    }
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I have implemented Percolate_Down as a separate
protected method, because it is used in two
places.  The first is <b>Pop()</b>, which moves the
last element to the root of the tree and percolates
down.  Here is the code for both <b>Percolate_Down()</b>,
<b>Pop()</b> and <b>Print()</b>.  <b>Percolate_Down()</b> has to test
a few cases, depending on whether there is a right child,
or whether the right child's value is less than the left
child's value.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=blue>/* I have implemented Percolate_Down as a separate
   protected method, because it is used in two
   places: Pop() and the vector constructor. */</font>

void PQueueHeap::Percolate_Down(size_t index)
{
  size_t lc, rc;
  double tmp;

  <font color=blue>/* lc is the left child, and
     rc is the right child. */</font>

  while (1) {                
    lc = index*2+1;
    rc = lc+1;
   
    <font color=blue>/* If index is on the bottom of the heap,
       then return, because we can't 
       percolate any more. */</font>

    if (lc &gt;= h.size()) return;

    <font color=blue>/* With this code, either there is no
       right child, or the left child is
       smaller than the right child.  In 
       this case, you need to compare the
       element at index with the left child. */</font>

    if (rc == h.size() || h[lc] &lt;= h[rc]) {
      if (h[lc] &lt; h[index]) {
        tmp = h[lc];
        h[lc] = h[index];
        h[index] = tmp;
        index = lc;
      } else {
        return;
      }

    <font color=blue>/* Otherwise, we compare the element at
       index with the right child. */</font>

    } else if (h[rc] &lt; h[index]) {
      tmp = h[rc];
      h[rc] = h[index];
      h[index] = tmp;
      index = rc;
    } else {
      return;
    }
  }
}
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
<font color=blue>/* With Pop(), after we error check, we
   move the last element to the root of
   the heap, and percolate down. */</font>

double PQueueHeap::Pop() 
{
  double retval;
  
  if (h.empty()) {
    throw (string) "Called Pop() on an empty PQueue";
  }
  retval = h[0];
  h[0] = h[h.size()-1];
  h.pop_back();
  if (h.size() == 0) return retval;
  Percolate_Down(0);
  return retval;
}

<font color=blue>/* The vector constructor calls Percolate_Down()
   on all non-leaf elements, going from the bottom 
   of the heap to the top. */</font>

PQueueHeap::PQueueHeap(const vector &lt;double&gt; &v) 
{ 
  int i;

  h = v;

  for (i = (int) h.size()/2-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) Percolate_Down(i);
}

<font color=blue>/* Print is straightforward. */</font>

void PQueueHeap::Print() const
{
  size_t i;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; h.size(); i++) {
    if (i != 0) cout &lt;&lt; " ";
    cout &lt;&lt; h[i];
  }
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Let's double-check ourselves with <b>bin/add_5</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/add_5 h</b></font>
Enter five numbers.
<font color=darkred><b>3 5 2 4 1</b></font>
1 2 3 5 4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/add_5 h</b></font>
Enter five numbers.
<font color=darkred><b>5 4 3 2 1</b></font>
1 2 4 5 3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

In the first call, we don't need to do any percolating when we insert
elements into the heap.  Thus, the vector has the values in order.
In the second call, the five add calls each percolate the new value
to the root of the heap:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><tr>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Add-5-1.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Add-5-2.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Add-5-3.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Add-5-4.png></td>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Add-5-5.png></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

To verify that percolating down works, let's compare <b>pq_sort</b> with the 
multiset implementation:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 5 txt/input.txt | bin/pq_sort h</b></font>
270.576
447.465
501.138
714.567
782.678
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/pq_sort h < txt/input.txt > txt/output3.txt</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>diff txt/output1.txt txt/output3.txt</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<h3>Constructing a heap from a vector</h3>

The final piece of the implementation  is the code that constructs the priority 
queue from an unsorted vector.  Obviously, you could simply <b>Push()</b> each element 
of the vector, which would make the constructor < <i>O(n(log(n)))</i>.
However, you can do better.  Let us do the following instead:
<p>
<UL> 
<LI> Create the binary tree directly from the vector.
<LI> Consider all the nodes at the bottom level of the tree.  Each of these nodes is a valid heap.
<LI> Now consider all the nodes at the next-to-bottom level of the tree.  If we call 
<b>Percolate_Down()</b>
on each of these nodes, then each of them will be a heap.
<LI> We keep doing this to each successively higher level of the tree until we call 
<b>Percolate_Down()</b>
on the root, and we are left with a valid heap.
</UL>
<p>

Below is an example.  Here's the vector that we want to turn into a heap:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td align=center width=20>77</td>
<td align=center width=20>21</td>
<td align=center width=20>55</td>
<td align=center width=20>94</td>
<td align=center width=20>1</td>
<td align=center width=20>27</td>
<td align=center width=20>7</td>
<td align=center width=20>67</td>
<td align=center width=20>61</td>
<td align=center width=20>78</td>
</table></center><p>

We convert the vector into a tree, as pictured below, and then we call <b>Percolate_Down()</b> 
on nodes
of each successively higher level.  These are the nodes pictured in yellow.  By the time we
get to the root, we have created a valid heap:


<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Linear-1.png></td>
<td valign=center align=center><img src=img/Linear-2.png></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top align=center><img src=img/Linear-3.png></td>
<td valign=center align=center><img src=img/Linear-4.png></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

To analyze the running time complexity, we need a little math.  Suppose our tree is complete at each
level.  The tree has <i>n</i> nodes, and thus its depth is <i>log(n)</i>.  The worst case performance
of <b>Percolate_Down()</b> for a node at level <i>i</i> is <i>log(n)-i</i>.  Thus, the performance of 
<b>Percolate_Down()</b>  for a node at the bottom level is 1;  for a node at the penultimate level, it is 2,
etc.  
<p>
The bottom level contains <i>(n+1)/2</i>  nodes, which is roughly <i>n/2</i>.  
Thus, all of the <b>Percolate_Down()</b>'s take <i>(1)(n/2)</i> = <i>n/2</i> operations.
At the next level, there are <i>n/4</i> nodes, whose <b>Percolate_Down()</b>'s take 2 operations each.
Thus, all of them take <i>2n/4</i>.  At the next level, there are <i>n/8</i> nodes whose
<b>Percolate_Down()</b>'s take 3 operations each.  Thus, all of them take <i>3n/8</i>.  Do you see the
pattern?   To help you, try the animated gif in 
<a href=img/vector.gif>img/vector.gif</a>, which shows the percolate down's for a 
heap with 511 elements.
<p>
The creation of the heap can be converted into a summation:
<p><center><table border=0 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><img src=img/Eq1.png></td></table></center><p>
To figure out what that second summation is, let's first write a quick C++ program to calculate its
value for the first 15 values of <i>n</i>.  The code is below 
(<b><a href=src/formula.cpp>src/formula.cpp</a></b>), and to the right, we show its output:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  double num, den, total, n;

  num = 1;
  den = 2;
  total = 0;
  
  for (n = 0; n &lt; 15; n++) {
    total += (num/den);
    num++;
    den *= 2;
    cout &lt;&lt; total &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
}
</pre></td><td valign=top width=200><pre>

</pre></td></table></center><p>

Looks like it converges to 2.  Let's analyze it mathematically.  Consider the following sum:

<p><center><table border=0 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><img src=img/Eq2.png></td></table></center><p>

Now, let's consider the equation <i>G - G/2</i>:
<p><center><table border=0 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><img src=img/Eq3.png></td></table></center><p>

From high school math, we know that this last summation equals one, so <i>G - G/2 = 1</i>, which 
means that <i>G = 2</i>.
<hr>
<h3>What is the upshot of all of this??</h3>

The upshot is that creating a heap from a vector is less than or equal to <i>Gn</i>, which means that
it is <i>O(n)</i> instead of <i>O(n(log(n)))</i>.  Is that significant?  
Let's test it -- here's the vector constructor in
<b><a href=src/pqueue_heap.cpp>src/pqueue_heap.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
PQueueHeap::PQueueHeap(const vector &lt;double&gt; &v) 
{ 
  int i;

  h = v;

  for (i = (int) h.size()/2-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) Percolate_Down(i);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

That was simple, wasn't it?  We test performance below:
<hr> 
<h3> Performance Testing</h3>

For our first performance test, let's use <b>bin/pq_sort</b>.  I have written
a very simple program called <b>src/genrandom.cpp</b> that prints a specified number
of random doubles.   My thought is to use <b>bin/genrandom</b> to generate test cases
for <b>bin/pq_sort</b>.  We'll pipe <b>bin/genrandom</b> into <b>bin/pq_sort</b> and then 
redirect the standard output of <b>bin/pq_sort</b> to <b>/dev/null</b>, which deletes it:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/genrandom 1000 | bin/pq_sort s > /dev/null</b></font>
UNIX>
</pre>

If we try to time this with <b>time</b>, we see no output:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time bin/genrandom 1000 | bin/pq_sort s > /dev/null</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

That's because <b>time's</b> output is also going to <b>/dev/null</b>.  To fix this, we have
<b>time</b> execute a subshell:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time sh -c "bin/genrandom 1000 | bin/pq_sort s > /dev/null"</b></font>
0.009u 0.005s 0:00.01 0.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Great -- now we can write a shell script called 
<b><a href=scripts/bigtest_1.sh>scripts/bigtest_1.sh</a></b>, which calls all three implementations with
input sizes ranging from 1000 to 100,000:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sh scripts/bigtest_1.sh | head</b></font>
s 1000 0.00
s 2000 0.01
s 3000 0.02
s 4000 0.02
s 5000 0.02
s 6000 0.04
s 7000 0.04
s 8000 0.05
s 9000 0.05
s 10000 0.05
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

It prints out the implementation, the number of doubles and the wall clock time in 
seconds (MacBook Pro in 2018).  The full data is in 
<b><a href=txt/test-data1.txt>txt/test-data1.txt</a></b>.  I graph it below (using 
jgraph - <b><a href=scripts/sort_test1.jgr>scripts/sort_test1.jgr</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><img src=img/sort_test1.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

That graph sucks.  The main reason is the squiggly lines -- what they indicate is that 
the individual data points have some variance, and that we should run more than one run
per test, averaging the results.  Still, if we ignore the squiggly lines, we draw two conclusions:

<OL>
<LI> The heap implementations are faster than the set implementation.
<LI> There is no appreciable difference between the two heap implementations.
</OL>

Is the second conclusion surprising?  Let's think about it some more.  What's going on 
when we are testing 100,000 numbers?

<UL>
<LI> We are generating and printing 100,000 numbers in <b>bin/genrandom</b>.
<LI> These characters are sent via the operating system as standard input to <b>bin/pq_test</b>.
<LI> <b>pq_test</b> sorts then and prints them.
<LI> The operating system eats the output.
</UL>

We are timing a lot of things here, in addition to what we want to be timing. 
In particular, we are timing a lot of I/O to and from <b>pq_test</b>.
Let's instead try timing just what we want to time -- the time to create the heap.

<p>
I've written a testing program called 
<b><a href=src/massive_create.cpp>src/massive_create.cpp</a></b>, which takes three command
line arguments:

<OL>
<LI> s, h or c
<LI> A number of elements
<LI> A number of iterations
</OL>

It then iterates for the given number of iterations, creating a priority queue with the
given number of random elements.  Once it is done creating the priority queue, it deletes
it.  In that way, we're only measuring the priority queue creation time.
I won't bother showing you the code -- you can get it from the link above.

<p>
I've also changed my shell script.  For each test, it runs <b>bin/massive_create</b> with
<i>i</i> iterations, where <i>i * n = 10,000,000</i>.  That gives me running times
on the order of .5 seconds per test.   I ran this on the Linux box in my office (so that
I'm not timing the 500 other things that my Macbook is doing right now), and varied
the number of elements from 10,000 to 1,000,000 (just 100,000 for the multiset).

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><img src=img/sort_test2.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

Those jumps in the red lines are interesting, aren't they?  I'll talk about them below.
<p>
That's a <i>BIG</i> difference, isn't it?  Look at the values on the axes -- these tests
are running roughly 100 times faster than the previous ones!
Not only are the lines smoother, but you can 
very clearly see the performance improvements between multiset and heap, and from the two
different constructors.  
<p>
What should you take from this?  First, that experimental computer science research
can be very tricky.  We had a simple goal: to demonstrate that a <i>O(n)</i> algorithm
runs faster than a <i>O(n(log(n)))</i> one.  We tried an obvious solution, and we couldn't
use it because we weren't really testing what we wanted to test.  When we rewrote our
testing programs to do a better job of removing the noise from the experiment, we were
able to demonstrate improved performance.  
<p>
Second, the <i>O(n)</i> algorithm is indeed faster.
<hr>
<h3>Those jumps, and effects of memory</h3>

I will not test you on this -- this is just optional material, in case you are interested.
<p>
The first question you should ask yourself is whether those jumps are due to instruction count
or memory.  When I see curves like that, I think "memory."  So, I instrumented <b>pqueue_heap.cpp</b> to keep track of the times it looks at an element of <b>v</b> in <b>Push()</b>.  
That is a rough estimate of
instruction count.  If you take a look at a graph of that, you'll see that the curve is smooth:
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/touches.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>
That is a hint that it's not instruction count that is causing the jumps.
<p>
Take a look at the following graphs.  In these, I have instrumented the programs so that they 
keep track of the elements of <b>v</b> that they access in each call to either <b>Percolate_Down()</b>, or <b>Push()</b>.  Here's the graph for creating the heap by repeatedly calling <b>Push()</b>.
Time goes from top to bottom.

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/SH.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

And here's the graph for creating the heap from the vector by repeatedly calling <b>Percolate_Down()</b>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/SVH.jpg width=500></td></table></center><p>

Can you see why the first graph would cause jumps with fixed-sized caches, and the second
would not?  This would be a great exercise for a cache modeling assignment.  We can talk about
it in class when we have the time.  Or, if I take the time to write about it, I'll do so for you.
