<h3>Priority Queue Clicker Questions, Set 2</h3>

In all of these questions, it may be helpful to know that:

<UL>
<LI> If a node of the heap is at index <i>i</i> of the vector, its left child is index <i>2i+1</i>.
<LI> If a node of the heap is at index <i>i</i> of the vector, its right child is index <i>2i+2</i>.
<LI> If a node of the heap is at index <i>i</i> of the vector, its parent is index <i>floor((i-1)/2)</i>.
</UL>

1. Suppose you have the following priority queue:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/clicker-2a.jpg width=800></td></table></center><p>

Suppose I call <b>Push(36)</b>.  When that's done, what is the index of the vector element
that equals 36?

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/clicker-2b.jpg width=800></td></table></center><p>

Suppose I call <b>Pop()</b>.  When that's done, what is the index of the vector element
that equals 30?

Suppose I call <b>Push(44)</b>.  When that's done, what is the index of the vector element
that equals 44?
