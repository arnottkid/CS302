<h3>Priority Queue Clicker Questions, Set 2, With answers</h3>

In all of these questions, it may be helpful to know that:

<UL>
<LI> If a node of the heap is at index <i>i</i> of the vector, its left child is index <i>2i+1</i>.
<LI> If a node of the heap is at index <i>i</i> of the vector, its right child is index <i>2i+2</i>.
<LI> If a node of the heap is at index <i>i</i> of the vector, its parent is index <i>floor((i-1)/2)</i>.
</UL>

1. Suppose you have the following priority queue:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/clicker-2a.jpg width=800></td></table></center><p>

Suppose I call <b>Push(36)</b>.  When that's done, what is the index of the vector element
that equals 36?
<p>
<i>Answer: You place 36 into a new node, which is the child of 88, and percolate up.  It
will swap places with 88 and 45, and then stop, because it is greater than its parent (30).
The index of that node is 6.
<p>
Why 6?  The root's index is 0.  The nodes at level 1 are indices 1-2.
The nodes at level 2 are indices 3-6, and this is the last of those.

2. Suppose you have the following priority queue:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/clicker-2b.jpg width=800></td></table></center><p>

Suppose I call <b>Pop()</b>.  When that's done, what is the index of the vector element
that equals 30?
<p>
<i>Answer: You will return 0.  You delete the node with 30 and put it at the root, and
percolate down.  This will swap 30 and 4, then 30 and 10, then 30 and 12.  It will stop
there.  The 
The index of that node is 11.</i>

3. Suppose you have the following vector representation of a priority queue:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/clicker-2c.jpg width=800></td></table></center><p>

Suppose I call <b>Push(44)</b>.  When that's done, what is the index of the vector element
that equals 44?  
<p>
<i>Answer: You don't need to draw pictures -- just use the equations at the top of this page:
<UL>
<LI> The new element goes at index 25.  
<LI> 25's parent is 12, whose value is 57: Swap.
<LI> 12's parent is 5, whose value is 52.  Swap.
<LI> 5's parent is 2, whose value is 19.  You're done, and the answer is 5.
</UL>

4. Suppose you have the following vector representation of a priority queue:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/clicker-2d.jpg width=800></td></table></center><p>

Suppose I call <b>Pop()</b>.  When that's done, what is the index of the vector element
that equals 85?

<p>
<i>Answer: Again, you don't need to draw pictures -- just use the equations at the top of this page:
<UL>
<LI> You will return 1.  You delete the last node, and put its value, 85, into the root.
<LI> You compare the root with its children, which are in indices 1 and 2.  The smallest is
     5, which is less than 85, so you swap 85 with 5.  85's index is now 1.
<LI> You now compare 85 with its children, which are in indices 3 and 4.  The smallest is
     8, which is less than 85, so you swap 85 with 8.  85's index is now 4.
<LI> You now compare 85 with its children, which are in indices 9 and 10.  The smallest is
     25, which is less than 85, so you swap 85 with 25.  85's index is now 10.
<LI> You now compare 85 with its children, which are in indices 21 and 22.  The smallest is
     45, which is less than 85, so you swap 85 with 45.  85's index is now 21.
<LI> 85 now has no children, so you're done.  The answer is 21.
</UL>
