<h3>Definition of Minimum Spanning Tree</h3>
The minimum spanning tree problem is simple: Given a connected, weighted, undirected graph, a <i>spanning tree</i> 
is a subset of edges that connects all of the vertices, but has no cycles.  A <i>minimum spanning tree</i> is a 
spanning tree where the sum of the weights of the edges is minimized.
Below, I draw a very simple example of a four-node graph on the left, and its minimum spanning
tree on the right:

Read the Wikipedia page for applications of spanning trees.
<p>
In this set of lecture notes, we'll teach you two algorithms for finding the minimum 
spanning tree: Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm:

<hr>
<h3>Prim's Algorithm</h3>

Prim's algorithm is a very simple modification to Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
With Prim's algorithm, you build the minimum spanning tree node by node.  
You are going to maintain a "current spanning tree", which will be a subset of the
nodes in the graph, and the edges that compose a minimum spanning tree of those nodes.
<p>
You start by setting the current spanning tree to an arbitrary node.  You'll note that
that node, with no edges, is indeed a spanning tree of that solitary node.
<p>
You then proceed to iterate, adding one node and one edge to the current spanning
tree.  What you'll do is find the minimum weight edge from a node in the current spanning
tree to a node not in the current spanning tree.  You add that node and edge to the
current spanning tree.  Keep doing that until all nodes are added to the spanning tree.
<p>
To implement Prim's algorithm, you maintain a multimap of edges, just like Dijkstra's algorithm.
However, the keys are the weights of the edges, rather than path lengths like they are
in Dijkstra's algorithm.  Each time you process an edge by adding the edge and its 
destination node to the current spanning tree.  Then you process the node's adjacency list,
adding more edges to the multimap.  You may need to delete edges from the multimap 
when you do this, because you may be improving a node's distance to the current spanning
tree.
<p>
Let's process an example -- you've seen this graph before:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=G5-1.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

I think it's safe to say that it's hard to eyeball this graph to find the minimum 
spanning tree.  So, let's run Prim's algorithm on it.  We'll arbitrarily put <i>s</i>
onto the current spanning tree.  In the pictures below, I'm going to denote the nodes
 in the current spanning tree in pink, and the edges in the current spanning tree in red.
I'll also draw the multimap of edges.  We'll start with <i>s</i> i the current spanning
tree:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=G5-2.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

We process the first edge in the multimap.  That will add the edge <i>s-n02</i> and the
node <i>n02</i> to the current spanning tree.  We add the edges to 
<i>n00</i>,
<i>n01</i> and <i>n03</i> to the multimap, and we update the edge to <i>n04</i>, because the
edge from <i>n02</i> is smaller than the one that is currently there (from <i>s</i>):

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=G5-3.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

Again, we process the smallest edge in the multimap.  That adds the edge <i>n02-n03</i>,
plus the node <i>n03</i> to the current spanning tree.  When we process edges, we see
that the edges to <i>n00</i> and <i>n04</i> need to be updated in the map:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=G5-4.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

Next, we add the edge <i>n03-n04</i>,
plus the node <i>n04</i> to the current spanning tree.  When we process edges, the only
modification is that we change the edge to <i>n00</i>:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=G5-5.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

I'll draw the remaining pictures without comment, until you see the final spanning tree:

<p><center><table border=3><tr><td><img src=G5-6.jpg height=300></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src=G5-7.jpg height=300></td></tr>
<tr><td><img src=G5-8.jpg height=300></td></tr>
</table></center><p>

Here's the final spanning tree:
<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=G5-9.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

The running time of Prim's algorithm is identical to Dijkstra's algorithm.  If we assume
that the graph is connected, then the running time is <i>O(|E|log(|V|))</i>.  To derive that,
consider that each time that we visit an edge, we may be deleting and inserting an edge
into the multimap.  The maximum size of the multimap is one entry per node -- hence the
<i>log(|V|)</i> term.

<h3>Kruskal's Algorithm</h3>

Whereas Prim's algorithm builds the spanning tree node by node, Kruskal's algorithm builds
it edge by edge.  The algorithm simple and elegant, in my opinion.  Start with your current
spanning tree composed of just the nodes, with no edges.  There are <i>|V|</i> connected
components in the current spanning tree.  
<p>
Sort the edges from smallest to largest and process them in that order.  For each edge,
determine if the edge spans two different connected components in the current spanning
tree.  If it doesn't, you ignore it.  If it does, then you add the edge to the spanning
tree, and the two connected components become one.
<p>
You repeat this process until you have just one connected component in the graph.
<p>
Implementing Kruskal's algorithm is straightforward -- sort edges in a multimap, 
and use <a href=../Disjoint/index.html>Disjoint Sets</a> to identify connected components.  
Let's go through the same example above, but using Kruskal's algorithm.  I'll draw
the current spanning tree, and keep the sorted list of edges to the right of the
drawing.   Here's our starting point:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Kruskal-1.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

We start with the smallest edge: <i>[n02-n03]</i>, and add it to the current spanning
tree.  It now has 6 connected components rather than seven:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Kruskal-2.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

We'll process the next two edges: <i>[n04-n03]</i>
<i>[n00-t]</i>.  Our graph now has four connected components:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Kruskal-3.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

Let's process the next two edges: <i>[n02-n01]</i> and
<i>[n03-n01]</i>.  We don't add the second of these two the graph, because it does not 
span connected components:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Kruskal-4.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

Similarly, edge <i>[n04-n02]</i> does not span connected components, so we ignore it. 
The next two edges, <i>[n00-n04]</i> and <i>[s-n02]</i> do span connected components, so we
add them to our spanning tree.  At that point, we are left with one component, so we're done!

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Kruskal-5.jpg height=300></td></table></center><p>

The running time of Kruskal's algorithm is 
<i>O(|E|log(|E|))</i> to sort the edges, and
<i>O(|E|&alpha;(|V|))</i> to process the edges.  Since the first time is larger than the second, we
can ignore the second term: 
<i>O(|E|log(|E|))</i>.  
<p>
Does that mean that Kruskal's algorithm is worse than Prim's algorithm?  Well, we can play games with math.
In the worst case, <i>|E| = O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)</i>, so:
<p>
<center>
<i>O(|E|log(|E|))</i> = <i>O(|E|log(|V|<sup>2</sup>))</i> <br>
= <i>O(|E|2log(|V|))</i><br>
= <i>O(|E|log(|V|))</i>.
</center>

So, they are equivalent from a big-O perspective.  You'd have to hack them up to see how well they work in
your own implementations.

<h3>Minimum Spanning Tree Esoterica</h3>

<UL>
<LI> If the edge weights are all unique, then so is the minimum spanning tree.
<LI> Negative edge weights don't matter.  In fact, you can add the same constant to every edge, and the
minimum spanning tree will remain the same.
<LI> Maximum spanning tree is the same thing, and both algorithms apply.
