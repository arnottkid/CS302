<h3>Debuggers</h3>

I'll quote <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger>Wikipedia</a> on the definition of a debugger: 
<p>
<UL>
<i>A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program used to test
and debug other programs (the "target" program).  The main use of a
debugger is to run the target program under controlled conditions
that permit the programmer to track its operations in progress and
monitor changes in computer resources (most often memory areas used
by the target program or the computer's operating system) that may
indicate malfunctioning code.  Typical debugging facilities include
the ability to run or halt the target program at specific points,
display the contents of memory, CPU registers or storage devices
(such as disk drives), and modify memory or register contents in
order to enter selected test data that might be a cause of faulty
program execution.</i>
</UL>
<p>
I only use a debugger in two cases:
<OL>
<LI> 1. My program is seg-faulting, and I can't reason as to why.
<LI> 2. I've received code from someone else, and I can't make sense of it.
</OL>

Neither of these is a good place to be, but sometimes it happens, and a debugger
is a good tool to help you, so you should have some basic weapons in your arsenal.

<p>
I'll go over <b>gdb</b>, as it's a basic, largely ubiquitous command line debugger.
Here's a good source of reference material for <b>gdb</b>: <a href=https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/index.html>https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb/index.html</a>.
<p>
Before I do so, let me quote some text from Dr. Ruoti, who finds great value in 
GUI-based debuggers:
<UL>
<I> My suggestion would be for students to use one of the many
graphical wrappers for GDB (<a
href=https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDB%20Front%20Ends>href=https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDB%20Front%20Ends</a>).
For example, they could use the built-in debugger in whatever IDE
they are already using (VSCode, Eclipse, Netbeans).  All of these
provide nice graphical wrappers to GDB that I think will work well
for students.  One of the nice benefits of them learning these
built-in debugger interfaces is that they also work for the other
languages the student might use in that IDE (Java, python, etc.).
This is one of the primary benefits of IDEs, learn one debugging
paradigm and it works for all your languages supported by that
debugger.
<p>
My core critique of GDB is in regards to using it directly from the command line. While GDB is still the debugger, I think learning how to use GUI wrappers for GDB best represents how students will use debuggers in practiceâ€”i.e., most developer use IDEs and their built in debuggers. 
</i></UL>

I include this because it's good to hear from someone who thinks that debuggers are valuable,
and to get some recommendations from them.  Also, if you feel as though <b>gdb</b> is clunky,
you have support for that feeling above, and can attempt to move on to a GUI-based debugger
if you want.

<hr>
<h3> Compiling for GDB</h3>

To compile for <b>gdb</b>, use the <b>-g</b> flag.  This puts a bunch of scaffolding into your
code, which the debugger uses to help you debug.  It also makes your code slower, so once you're
done debugging, you should compile again without the flag (and with optimization) to make your
code fast.

<hr>
<h3>Where's my seg fault happening?</h3>

I have a buggy program in 
<b><a href=src/sf1.cpp>src/sf1.cpp</a></b>.  This program reads "events" into a multimap,
sorted on time.  It treats events that are termed "Arrival" differently from the other
events, counting them in addition to putting them onto the multimap.  At the end of the program,
it prints out the multimap.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
using namespace std;

class Event {
  public: 
    string type;
    double time;
};

int main()
{
  multimap &lt;double, Event *&gt; events;
  multimap &lt;double, Event *&gt;::iterator eit;
  Event *e;
  string type;
  double time;
  int arrival_events;

  arrival_events = 0;
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
  while (cin &gt;&gt; type &gt;&gt; time) {
    if (type != "Arrival") {
      e = new Event;
      e-&gt;type = type;
      e-&gt;time = time;
      events.insert(make_pair(time, e));
    } else {
      arrival_events++;
      e-&gt;type = "Arrival";
      e-&gt;time = time;
      events.insert(make_pair(time, e));
    }
  }

  for (eit = events.begin(); eit != events.end(); eit++) {
    e = eit-&gt;second;
    printf("%7.4lf %s\n", e-&gt;time, e-&gt;type.c_str());
  }
  printf("Arrival events: %d\n", arrival_events);

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The makefile compiles it with the debugging flag:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make clean</b></font>
rm -f a.out bin/*
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make bin/sf1</b></font>
g++ -g -o bin/sf1 src/sf1.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

When we run it on
<b><a href=txt/input0.txt>txt/input0.txt</a></b>, it seg faults:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/sf1 < txt/input0.txt </b></font>
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Here's a common use for <b>gdb</b>.  First, you run the program under the control of <b>gdb</b>:

<pre> 
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>gdb bin/sf1</b></font>
GNU gdb (GDB) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6.1-119.el7
Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<font color=blue># ...</font>
Reading symbols from /home/jplank/cs302/Notes/GDB/bin/sf1...done.
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>run < txt/input0.txt</b></font>
Starting program: /home/jplank/cs302/Notes/GDB/bin/sf1 < txt/input0.txt

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
std::string::assign (this=0x400bd0 <_start>, __s=0x401b00 "Arrival", __n=7)
    at /usr/src/debug/gcc-4.8.5-20150702/obj-x86_64-redhat-linux/x86_64-redhat-linux/libstdc++-v3/include/bits/basic_string.tcc:262
262       _M_check_length(this->size(), __n, "basic_string::assign");
(gdb)
</pre>

The output is a little noisy, but you can see that there has been a segmentation violation.
It appears to be in line 262 of the file <b>basic_string.tcc</b>, which of course is a file
that you don't use directly, but is part of the C++ string library.  There won't be a bug there --
however, where it means is that you've made a bug which causes a segmentation violation in 
their code.  The command <b>backtrace</b> will tell you what procedures have been called in 
the execution path to the segmentation violation:

<pre> 
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>backtrace</b></font>
#0  std::string::assign (this=0x400bd0 <_start>, __s=0x401b00 "Arrival", __n=7)
    at /usr/src/debug/gcc-4.8.5-20150702/obj-x86_64-redhat-linux/x86_64-redhat-linux/libstdc++-v3/include/bits/basic_string.tcc:262
#1  0x0000000000400dd7 in main () at src/sf1.cpp:32
(gdb)
</pre>

This is the number one helpful thing about <b>gdb</b> -- your segmentation violation is happening
in line 32 of <b>src/sf1.cpp</b>.  You can go to your favorite editor and see line 32, but you 
can also see it in <b>gdb</b>.  Your procedure call stack is partitioned into <i>frames</i>, which
are numbered in the output to <b>backtrace</b>.  Frame 0 is in <b>std::string::assign()</b>.
Frame 1 is in your <b>main()</b>.  You are currently "at" frame 0.  To "go" to frame 1, type
"up", or perhaps more clearly, "frame 1".

<pre> 
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>frame 1</b></font>
#1  0x0000000000400dd7 in main () at src/sf1.cpp:32
32            e->type = "Arrival";
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

You'll note, it shows you line 32, which looks pretty harmless.  How can that line cause a
segmentation violation?  There is really only one way -- <b>e</b> must be a bad pointer.
Often that's all you need to find your bug.  You don't need to muck around with a debugger --
figure out why <b>e</b> is a bad pointer.  
<p>
It shouldn't be hard to realize that you forgot to make <b>e</b> a new Event.  But let's 
have the debugger help us.  Maybe.  First, you can print the local variables in your frame with
"info locals":

<pre> 
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>info locals</b></font>
e = 0x400bd0 <_start>
type = "Arrival"
events = std::multimap with 0 elements
eit = <error reading variable eit (Cannot access memory at address 0x20)>
time = 80.213791000000001
arrival_events = 1
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>print e->type</b></font>
</pre>

That address for <b>e</b> looks suspicious, doesn't it?  Of course, hex digits can be anything.
You can print individual variables -- that will help us see that <b>e</b> is a bad address:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>print e</b></font>
$2 = (Event *) 0x400bd0 <_start>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>print e->type</b></font>
$3 = <error reading variable: Cannot access memory at address 0x89485ed18949ed19>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Bingo!  Something's wrong with <b>e</b>.

<hr>
<h3>Setting breakpoints and setting variables to take a look at what's going on</h3>

Let's confirm that <b>e</b> is being used uninitialized.  To do that, we're going to do
the following:

<UL>
<LI> We're going to set breakpoints so that our program stops before the main while loop,
and again when it sees an "Arrival" event.
<LI> Before the main loop, we're going to set <b>e</b> to NULL.
<LI> Then, when we see the first "Arrival" event, we'll print <b>e</b> to confirm that it's
NULL, and that we're about to have a seg fault.
<LI> Then we'll generate the seg fault.
</UL>

First, we'll use the "list" command to see numbered lines of <b>main()</b>:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>list main</b></font>
9     string type;
10      double time;
11  };
12  
13  int main()
14  {
15    multimap <double, Event *> events;
16    multimap <double, Event *>::iterator eit;
17    Event *e;
18    string type;
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>list</b></font>
19    double time;
20    int arrival_events;
21  
22    arrival_events = 0;
23  
24    while (cin >> type >> time) {
25      if (type != "Arrival") {
26        e = new Event;
27        e->type = type;
28        e->time = time;
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>list</b></font>
29        events.insert(make_pair(time, e));
30      } else {
31        arrival_events++;
32        e->type = "Arrival";
33        e->time = time;
34        events.insert(make_pair(time, e));
35      }
36    }
37  
38    for (eit = events.begin(); eit != events.end(); eit++) {
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Then, we'll put "breakpoints" at lines 22 and 31:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>b 22</b></font>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400cf5: file src/sf1.cpp, line 22.
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>b 31</b></font>
Breakpoint 2 at 0x400dc2: file src/sf1.cpp, line 31.
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

And run the program on <b>txt/input0.txt</b> again.  You'll note that the previous
run hasn't completed, so we restart it.  That will throw away the current run of the program:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>run < txt/input0.txt</b></font>
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y

Starting program: /home/jplank/cs302/Notes/GDB/bin/sf1 < txt/input0.txt

Breakpoint 1, main () at src/sf1.cpp:22
22    arrival_events = 0;
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

It has stopped at our breakpoint.  We can examine <b>e</b>, which is uninitialized:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>print e</b></font>
$4 = (Event *) 0x400bd0 <_start>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Let's set it to NULL -- you can do that with "set".  Of course, the debugger doesn't recognize
NULL, but we're smart enough to know that NULL is zero:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>set var e=0</b></font>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>print e</b></font>
$6 = (Event *)</font> 0x0                          <font color=blue> # The dollars sign numbers may differ for you.</font>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>print e->type</b></font>
Cannot access memory at address 0x0
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

We type "cont" to continue to the next breakpoint, which is where we get the first "Arrival"
event.  You'll note that <b>events</b> has 0 elements, so this is the first line of input.
That means that <b>e</b> is still NULL (which you can see in the "info locals" command):

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>cont</b></font>
Continuing.

Breakpoint 2, main () at src/sf1.cpp:31
31        arrival_events++;
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>info locals</b></font>
e = 0x0
type = "Arrival"
events = std::multimap with 0 elements
eit = <error reading variable eit (Cannot access memory at address 0x20)>
time = 80.213791000000001
arrival_events = 0
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Typing "cont" will now generate the segmentation violation, as you try to set <b>e->type</b>
on line 32:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>cont</b></font>
Continuing.

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
std::string::assign (this=0x0, __s=0x401b00 "Arrival", __n=7)
    at /usr/src/debug/gcc-4.8.5-20150702/obj-x86_64-redhat-linux/x86_64-redhat-linux/libstdc++-v3/include/bits/basic_string.tcc:262
262       _M_check_length(this->size(), __n, "basic_string::assign");
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The segfault made finding that bug easier, didn't it?  A corollary to this is that you may
want to initialize your pointers to NULL, even though a correct program will never read them.
The reason is that if you have a bug, where the pointer gets read uninitialized, you'll 
find it easier with the segmentation violation.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Setting watchpoints</h3>

Now, let's try to find the same bug, but in a more difficult scenario.  The input file
in <b><a href=txt/input1.txt>txt/input1.txt</a></b> doesn't start with an "Arrival" event.
That means that when you do get to an "Arrival" event, you're going to modify a previous
event which is already on the map.  The map will print out too many "Arrival" events, and
some non-arrival events will be eaten.  In particular, the "Ava-Rafael" event on line 6
will be turned into an Arrival event.  Let's confirm all of that with some standard Unix
command line tools:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n txt/input1.txt | grep Arrival</b></font>
     7  Arrival 66.629794
    13  Arrival 82.201580
    24  Arrival 77.338365
    39  Arrival 84.262522
    69  Arrival 20.367907
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n txt/input1.txt | sed -n 6p                    <font color=blue> # This line is one before an Arrival event.</b></font></font>
     6  Ava-Rafael 62.063342
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/sf1 < txt/input1.txt > txt/output1-wrong.txt     </b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/sf2 < txt/input1.txt > txt/output1-correct.txt   <font color=blue> # sf2 is the correct version of the program</b></font></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n txt/output1-correct.txt | grep Ava-R          <font color=blue> # In the correct output, Ava-Rafael is on line 64.</b></font></font>
    64  62.0633 Ava-Rafael
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n txt/output1-wrong.txt | sed -n 64p            <font color=blue> # In the incorrect output, this has been turned into the Arrival event from line 7.</b></font></font>
    64  66.6298 Arrival
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n txt/output1-correct.txt | grep 66.6298        <font color=blue> # Looking at this in another way, the Arrival event is line 69 of the correct output.</b></font></font>
    69  66.6298 Arrival
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n txt/output1-wrong.txt | grep 66.6298          <font color=blue> # In the incorrect output, it's on both lines 69 and 64.</b></font></font>
    64  66.6298 Arrival
    69  66.6298 Arrival
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Great.  All of this makes sense, because we already know about the bug.  Now, let's suppose that we
didn't know about the bug.  We've written our program, and it's getting a gradescript
wrong, because your output is not matching the correct output:

<pre> 
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>openssl md5 txt/output1*              <font color=blue> # This confirms that the two outputs differ.</b></font></font>
MD5(txt/output1-correct.txt)= 8e7d6cb48c0a5891955254337826f3b1
MD5(txt/output1-wrong.txt)= bee14bd84a63482581997c3b148a6852  
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>diff -y txt/output1* | grep '|'       <font color=blue> # This shows the lines where they differ.</b></font></font>                   
61.8246 Gabriel-Writeup                                       | 20.3679 Arrival
62.0633 Ava-Rafael                                            | 66.6298 Arrival
87.8991 Sophia-Whiz                                           | 84.2625 Arrival
91.0791 Riley-Inception                                       | 77.3384 Arrival
92.9222 Zoe-Checkerberry                                      | 82.2016 Arrival
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

So, there are five lines in the output where the correct output is being turned into an "Arrival".
Let's use a watchpoint to figure out where this is happening.  First, here are the first
ten lines of the input file.  As you can see, the "Ava-Rafael" event is on line 6, and there's
an "Arrival" event on line 7.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat -n txt/input1.txt | head</b></font>
     1  Abigail-Johnson 80.213791
     2  Bailey-Concordant 93.932086
     3  Grace-Pentagon 94.684299
     4  Riley-Disposal 57.560029
     5  Jack-Goer 84.855482
     6  Ava-Rafael 62.063342
     7  Arrival 66.629794
     8  Joseph-Nostalgic 19.156007
     9  Nicholas-Deneb 99.282122
    10  Cameron-Impunity 16.390366
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

What we want to do is have the debugger stop when we see "Ava-Rafael".  We'll do that by 
putting a breakpoint at line 27, and then going to the 6th time that we get to that
line.  At that point, <b>type</b> should equal "Ava-Rafael":

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>cat -n src/sf1.cpp | sed -n 25,29p</b></font>
    25      if (type != "Arrival") {
    26        e = new Event;
    27        e->type = type;
    28        e->time = time;
    29        events.insert(make_pair(time, e));

(gdb) <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The "next" command performs the next line.  If the line is a procedure or method call, it will make
the call and resume control after the call is done.  The "step" command is the same as "next", but
it goes "into" functions and lets you step through them.  We won't call "step" here -- just "next":

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>info locals</b></font>

As you can see, we've put <b>e</b> onto the multimap, and that added an element to the multimap.
Now, what I want to do is have the debugger tell me when something happens to "Ava-Rafael"'s
event.  That's harder than I'd like it to be.  What I'm going to do is "watch" the address
of <b>e->time</b>.  If it gets overwritten, the debugger will tell me.  Here we go, 
with commentary inline:

<pre>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>print &(e->time)</b></font>   <font color=blue> # Show me the address of e->time</font>
$5 = (double *)</font> 0x604438
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>watch *0x604438</b></font>    <font color=blue> # Tell the debugger to watch it.</font>
Hardware watchpoint 2: *0x604438
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>delete 1</b></font>           <font color=blue> # Delete the breakpoint on line 27</font>
(gdb) <font color=darkred><b>cont</b></font>               <font color=blue> # Continue running</font>
Continuing.
Hardware watchpoint 2: *0x604438                           <font color=blue> # The hardware has detected that e->time has changed.</font>

Why did I watch the address of <b>e->time</b> and not <b>e</b> or <b>e->type</b>?  The reason is
that <b>e->type</b> is a C++ string, and its semantics are a little different.  The time is
simply 8 bytes, so it's easy to watch.

<h3>Commentary</h3>

I hope this gives you a little of the flavor of using a command-line debugger.  As Dr. Ruoti
says above, there are better debuggers with much better features.  Whenever you use an IDE,
you should explore its features for debuggin.

<h3>Lab Project1</h3>

I have taken the program <b>sudoku5.cpp</b> from the
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/Recursion-Review/>Recursion Review</a> lecture notes, and annotated it so that it prints out the number of times <b>Solve()</b>
is called.  When you run it on the puzzle in 
<b><a href=txt/s_test.txt>txt/s_test.txt</a></b>, it takes 7,789 calls.

Your job is to run <b>bin/sudoku5</b> under the control of <b>gdb</b>, and within
<b>gdb</b>, after you've read in the puzzle, but before you call <b>Solve</b>, 
set the first element of the puzzle to '9'.  Then see how many calls
to <b>Solve()</b> it takes to solve the puzzle.  The answer is 1956.
