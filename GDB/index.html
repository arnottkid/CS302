<h3>Debuggers</h3>

I'll quote <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger>Wikipedia</a> on the definition of a debugger: 
<p>
<UL>
<i>A debugger or debugging tool is a computer program used to test
and debug other programs (the "target" program).  The main use of a
debugger is to run the target program under controlled conditions
that permit the programmer to track its operations in progress and
monitor changes in computer resources (most often memory areas used
by the target program or the computer's operating system) that may
indicate malfunctioning code.  Typical debugging facilities include
the ability to run or halt the target program at specific points,
display the contents of memory, CPU registers or storage devices
(such as disk drives), and modify memory or register contents in
order to enter selected test data that might be a cause of faulty
program execution.</i>

<p>
I only use a debugger in two cases:
<OL>
<LI> 1. My program is seg-faulting, and I can't reason as to why.
<LI> 2. I've received code from someone else, and I can't make sense of it.
</OL>

Neither of these is a good place to be, but sometimes it happens, and a debugger
is a good tool to help you, so you should have some basic weapons in your arsenal.

<p>
I'll go over <b>gdb</b>, as it's a basic, largely ubiquitous command line debugger.
<p>
Before I do so, let me quote some text from Dr. Ruoti, who finds great value in 
GUI-based debuggers:
<UL>
<I> My suggestion would be for students to use one of the many
graphical wrappers for GDB (<a
href=https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDB%20Front%20Ends>href=https://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/GDB%20Front%20Ends</a>).
For example, they could use the built-in debugger in whatever IDE
they are already using (VSCode, Eclipse, Netbeans).  All of these
provide nice graphical wrappers to GDB that I think will work well
for students.  One of the nice benefits of them learning these
built-in debugger interfaces is that they also work for the other
languages the student might use in that IDE (Java, python, etc.).
This is one of the primary benefits of IDEs, learn one debugging
paradigm and it works for all your languages supported by that
debugger.
<p>
My core critique of GDB is in regards to using it directly from the command line. While GDB is still the debugger, I think learning how to use GUI wrappers for GDB best represents how students will use debuggers in practiceâ€”i.e., most developer use IDEs and their built in debuggers.
