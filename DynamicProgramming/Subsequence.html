This one comes from a topcoder article by
<a href=http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=features&d2=040104>vorthys</a>.
You are to write a program that takes two strings and returns the length of the largest
common subsequence of the two strings.  A subsequence is a subset of the letters of a string
that appears in the order given by the subsequence.  For example, "dog" is a subsequence
if "dodger", but "red" is not, because the characters don't appear in "dodger" in the 
correct order.
<p>
As always, we start with <b>Step 1</b>, which is to spot the recursive solution.  To do so,
let's take a look at two examples.  Here's the first example:
<p>
<center>
S1 = "AbbbcccFyy", S2 = "FxxxyyyAc"
<p>
</center>
And here's the second example.
<p>
<center>
S1 = "AbbbcccFyy", S2 = "FxxxyyyAccc"
</center>
<p>
You should see that these examples are related.  In the first, the longest subsequence is "Fyy",
and in the second, the longest subsequence is "Accc".  This example highlights the difficulty
of this problem -- If you start looking for subsequences from the beginning of either string,
the result may be affected by the end of the string.  We'll return to these examples in a bit.
Let's try another example:
<p>
<center>
S1 = "9009709947053769973735856707811337348914", S2 = "9404888367379074754510954922399291912221"
</center>
<p>
Man, that looks hard.  Don't even bother trying to solve it.  However, one thing you do know --
the maximum subsequence starts with a 9.  Why?  It has to -- you can prove this to yourself
by contradiction: If the subsequence is <i>S</i> and <i>S</i> doesn't start with 9, then there is
a valid subsequence which is "9"+<i>S</I>.  
<p>
I'm hoping these examples help you spot the recursion:  You will compare the first letters of
both substrings, and do different things depending on whether they equal each other:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> If <b>S1[0] == S2[0]</b>, then the answer is one plus the maximum subsequence of
<b>S1.substr(1)</b> and 
<b>S2.substr(1)</b>.  (This method returns the substring starting at index 1 and going to
the end of the string).
<p><LI> If <b>S1[0] != S2[0]</b>, then you know that the maximum subsequence either does
not start with <b>S1[0]</b> or does not start with <b>S2[0]</b>.  Thus, you should
determine 
the maximum subsequence of <b>S1</b> and <b>S2.substr(1)</b>, and 
the maximum subsequence of <b>S2</b> and <b>S1.substr(1)</b>.  
The answer has to be one of these.
</UL>
<p>
Let's hack that up.  It's in 
<b><a href=subseq1.cpp>subseq1.cpp</a></b>. (There's a <b>main()</b> that reads the
two strings from the command line.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int LCS(string s1, string s2)
{
  int r1, r2;

  <font color=blue>/* Base case -- if either string is empty, return 0. */</font>

  if (s1.size() == 0 || s2.size() == 0) return 0;

  <font color=blue>/* If the first characters of the two strings equal each other,
     then the answer is one plus the LCS of the two string with
     the first characters chopped off. */</font>

  if (s1[0] == s2[0]) return 1 + LCS(s1.substr(1), s2.substr(1));

  <font color=blue>/* Otherwise, the answer is either:
       - The LCS of the 1st string, and the 2nd string without its first character.
       - The LCS of the 2nd string, and the 1st string without its first character.
   */   </font>

  r1 = LCS(s1, s2.substr(1));
  r2 = LCS(s1.substr(1), s2);
  return (r1 &gt; r2) ? r1 : r2;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It seems to work on our examples:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o subseq1 subseq1.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq1 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAc</b></font>
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq1 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAccc</b></font>
4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq1 9009709947053769973735856707811337348914 9404888367379074754510954922399291912221</b></font>
</pre>

However, it hangs on that last one.  Why?  Exponential blow-up of duplicate calls.  Let's
memoize.  This is an easy memoization on the strings -- just concatenate them with a 
character that can't be in either string -- I'll choose a colon here.  I'm 
going to turn the solution into a class so that storing the cache is easier.  
It's in <b><a href=subseq2.cpp>subseq2.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Subseq {
  public:
    map &lt;string, int&gt; cache;
    int LCS(string s1, string s2);
};

int Subseq::LCS(string s1, string s2)
{
  string key;
  int r1, r2;

  if (s1.size() == 0 || s2.size() == 0) return 0;

  key = s1 + ":";
  key += s2;
  if (cache.find(key) != cache.end()) return cache[key];

  if (s1[0] == s2[0]) {
   cache[key] = 1 + LCS(s1.substr(1), s2.substr(1));
  } else {
    r1 = LCS(s1, s2.substr(1));
    r2 = LCS(s2, s1.substr(1));
    cache[key] = (r1 &gt; r2) ? r1 : r2;
  }
  return cache[key];
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This works fine on our examples:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o subseq2 subseq2.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq2 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAc</b></font>
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq2 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAccc</b></font>
4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq2 9009709947053769973735856707811337348914 9404888367379074754510954922399291912221</b></font>
15
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

However, this solution should make you feel uneasy.  It makes me feel uneasy.  The reason is
that each call to <b>LCS</b> makes a copy of its arguments, and each call to <b>substr()</b>
creates a new string which is just one character smaller than the previous string.  That's
a lot of memory.  To hammer home this point, the file
<b><a href=sub-big.txt>sub-big.txt</a></b>
has two 3000-character strings.  When we call <b>subseq2</b> on it, it hangs because it is making
so many copies of large strings:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq2 `cat sub-big.txt`</b></font>
</pre>

Think about it -- each substring is a suffix of the previous one, so for S1 and S2 there are
roughly 3000 suffixes.  That means potentially 3000 * 3000 calls to <b>LCS()</b>, each time 
creating strings of size up to 3000.  That's a huge amount of time and memory.  
<p>
Since we are only using suffixes of S1 and S2, we can represent them with indices to their
first characters, and we call <b>LCS()</b> on these indices rather than on the strings.
I've put that code into <b><a href=subseq3.cpp>subseq3.cpp</a></b>.  It doesn't memoize.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Subseq {
  public:
    string s1, s2;
    int LCS(int i1, int i2);
};

int Subseq::LCS(int i1, int i2)
{
  int r1, r2;

  if (s1.size() == i1 || s2.size() == i2) return 0;

  if (s1[i1] == s2[i2]) {
    return 1 + LCS(i1+1, i2+1);
  } else {
    r1 = LCS(i1, i2+1);
    r2 = LCS(i1+1, i2);
    return (r1 &gt; r2) ? r1 : r2;
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It works, although since it doesn't memoize, it hangs on the long input.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq3 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAc</b></font>
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq3 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAccc</b></font>
4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq3 9009709947053769973735856707811337348914 9404888367379074754510954922399291912221</b></font>
</pre>

We memoize in <b><a href=subseq4.cpp>subseq4.cpp</a></b>.  Our cache is on the 
indices, and is thus of size <b>s1.size() * s2.size()</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Subseq {
  public:
    string s1, s2;
    vector &lt; vector &lt;int&gt; &gt; cache;
    int LCS(int i1, int i2);
};

int Subseq::LCS(int i1, int i2)
{
  int r1, r2, i;

  if (s1.size() == i1 || s2.size() == i2) return 0;

  if (cache.size() == 0) {
    cache.resize(s1.size());
    for (i = 0; i &lt; s1.size(); i++) cache[i].resize(s2.size(), -1);
  }

  if (cache[i1][i2] != -1) return cache[i1][i2];

  if (s1[i1] == s2[i2]) {
   cache[i1][i2] = 1 + LCS(i1+1, i2+1);
  } else {
    r1 = LCS(i1, i2+1);
    r2 = LCS(i1+1, i2);
    cache[i1][i2] = (r1 &gt; r2) ? r1 : r2;
  }
  return cache[i1][i2]; 
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now this version is fast, and it even works on the huge input in under a second without
compiler optimization!

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -o subseq4 subseq4.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq4 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAc</b></font>
3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq4 AbbbcccFyy FxxxyyyAccc</b></font>
4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>subseq4 9009709947053769973735856707811337348914 9404888367379074754510954922399291912221</b></font>
15
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time subseq4 `cat sub-big.txt`</b></font>
891
0.930u 0.040s 0:00.96 101.0%  0+0k 16+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

It's faster with optimization:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>g++ -O3 -o subseq4 subseq4.cpp</b></font>
UNIX> time subseq4 `cat sub-big.txt`
891
0.310u 0.040s 0:00.33 106.0%  0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> 
</pre>

We can perform step #3 on this by realizing that you perform the recursion on larger indices,
so you build the cache from high to low.  This is in
<b><a href=subseq5.cpp>subseq5.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Subseq::LCS()
{
  int r1, r2, i, i1, i2;

  cache.resize(s1.size()+1);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; cache.size(); i++) cache[i].resize(s2.size()+1, -1);

  for (i = 0; i &lt;= s1.size(); i++) cache[i][s2.size()] = 0;
  for (i = 0; i &lt;= s2.size(); i++) cache[s1.size()][i] = 0;

  for (i1 = s1.size()-1; i1 &gt;= 0; i1--) {
    for (i2 = s2.size()-1; i2 &gt;= 0; i2--) {
      if (s1[i1] == s2[i2]) {
       cache[i1][i2] = 1 + cache[i1+1][i2+1];
      } else {
        r1 = cache[i1][i2+1];
        r2 = cache[i1+1][i2];
        cache[i1][i2] = (r1 &gt; r2) ? r1 : r2;
      }
    }
  }
  return cache[0][0]; 
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This is much faster than the previous code:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time subseq5 `cat sub-big.txt `</b></font>
891
0.052u 0.036s 0:00.09 88.8% 0+0k 40+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Finally, we can perform step 4 on this by only keeping two rows, and performing 
the arithmetic on <i>i1</i> mod 2.  Now, the cache only contains <b>(2*s2.size())</b> 
entries.  The
code is in <b><a href=subseq6.cpp>subseq6.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Subseq::LCS()
{
  int r1, r2, i, i1, i2, index, other;

  cache.resize(2);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; cache.size(); i++) cache[i].resize(s2.size()+1, 0);

  for (i1 = s1.size()-1; i1 &gt;= 0; i1--) {
    index = i1%2;
    other = (i1+1)%2;
    for (i2 = s2.size()-1; i2 &gt;= 0; i2--) {
      if (s1[i1] == s2[i2]) {
       cache[index][i2] = 1 + cache[other][i2+1];
      } else {
        r1 = cache[index][i2+1];
        r2 = cache[other][i2];
        cache[index][i2] = (r1 &gt; r2) ? r1 : r2;
      }
    }
  }
  return cache[0][0]; 
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It runs at the same speed as before, but uses much less memory:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time subseq6 `cat sub-big.txt `</b></font>
891
0.052u 0.000s 0:00.05 100.0%  0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Here's a curiousity -- take a look at the timings and the output and see if you can figure
out what's going on:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>wc sub-big.txt</b></font>
   2    2 5353 sub-big.txt
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>wc sub-big-2.txt</b></font>
   2    2 5186 sub-big-2.txt
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time subseq4 `cat sub-big-2.txt`</b></font>
2592
0.000u 0.036s 0:00.04 75.0% 0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time subseq5 `cat sub-big-2.txt`</b></font>
2592
0.060u 0.020s 0:00.08 100.0%  0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time subseq6 `cat sub-big-2.txt`</b></font>
2592
0.044u 0.004s 0:00.05 80.0% 0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Why is this interesting?  Well, 
<b><a href=sub-big-2.txt>sub-big-2.txt</a></b> is nearly the same size as
<b><a href=sub-big.txt>sub-big.txt</a></b>.  <b>subseq5</b> and <b>subseq6</b> take
about the same amount of time to run on it, but <b>subseq4</b> is <i>much</i> faster.
Why would that be the case?
<p>
Take a look at the output -- the maximum subsequence size is 2592, pretty much half the
size of the input file.  You can confirm that the two strings are in fact the same:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sort -u sub-big-2.txt | wc</b></font>
      1       1    2593
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Why would <b>subseq4</b> be so much faster than the others -- well, because it simply
does the one recursion at every step, ending after 2592 recursive calls.  <b>subseq5</b>, 
on the other hand, builds that 2592x2592 cache without realizing that pretty much none of
the cache is getting used.  Same with <b>subseq6</b>, except it only stores the last two
rows.

<h3>Some Call Graphs</h3>

In case some pictures help, here's the call graph of calling <b>subseq1.cpp</b>
on "Dog" and "Dodger".    You should see how this gives us an answer of three.

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=Dog-Dodger.jpg></td></table></center><p>

I have a much larger call graph for "AbbbcccFyy" and "FxxxyyyAc" below (click on it
to see the full-size picture).  In this graph, the red edges are calls when the first
characters don't match, and the blue edges are when they do match.  The calls go down 
and to the right.  I have widened the calls that lead to the correct answer.
