<hr>
In this lecture, we are going to program the generic Ford-Fulkerson algorithm
for network flow.
We will represent directed, weighted graphs in text files, read them into
a graph data structure, then find the maximum flow.
We won't put any smarts into finding augmenting paths.  We will simply use DFS.

<h3>Graph Representation and Generating Random Graphs</h3>

We are going to represent graphs with a very flexible file format.  The file
will contain a stream of words, which should be in the following format:
<UL>
<LI> <b>EDGE</b> <i>n1 n2 capacity</i> -- This specifies that there is an edge from
node <i>n1</i> to node <i>n2</i> with the given capacity.  Capacities must be positive 
integers.  If an edge is specified multiple times, then the capacities are added.
It is fine to have edges in both directions between a pair of nodes.
<LI> <b>SOURCE</b> <i>name</i> -- This specifies the name of the source node.
<LI> <b>SINK</b> <i>name</i> -- This specifies the name of the sink node.
</UL>

There must be a single source and sink.
<p>
So, for example, below are two files that represent the 
graph from the <a href=lecture-1.html>First set of network flow lecture notes</a>.
They differ in the order in which they specify edges.  Thus, the graph is the same,
but the order of the adjacency lists will differ.

I also have a program that generates random graphs, called
<b><a href=src/makerandom.cpp>src/makerandom.cpp</a></b>.
This program takes one or two arguments.  The first argument is a number of nodes.
The second number is an optional seed to <b>srand48()</b>.
The program creates a random graph with one source, one sink, and the
given number of other nodes.  There is a random edge between every
pair of nodes (in a random direction) with a random integer capacity between
1 and 10,000. There are edges from the source to random nodes with a
40% probability, and there are edges to the sink from random nodes
with a 40% probability.  Thus, this is a pretty dense graph which
should be a challenge to our network flow programs.
<p>

Below is an example of a graph made with <b>makerandom</b> 5. 
I think we can all agree that finding the maximum flow through this graph will be a bit of a challenge. To help you, I've colored the edges in the minimum cut red:


<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>

<b><a href=g5.txt>g5.txt</a>:</b><pre>

And here's a graph showing the maximum flow of
10,087

<h3>The Implementations</h3>

I have eight network flow implementations.  I will only explain a few of them in 
detail; however, I will explain how they each differ, and I will do a performance
comparison.

<hr>
<h3>The Classes in the Program</h3>

I will start my implementation with the program 
<b><a href=src/netflow_skeleton.cpp>src/netflow_skeleton.cpp</a></b>.  This
sets up the classes and reads the graph.  We will modify it to calculate the maximum flow.
<p>
My program has three basic classes: <b>Node</b>, <b>Edge</b> and <b>Graph</b>.
Let's start with the <b>Node</b> and <b>Edge</b> classes:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td valign=top><pre>
class Node {
  public: 
    string name;
    vector &lt;class Edge *&gt; adj;
    int visited;
};
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
class Edge {
  public:
    void Print();
    string name;
    Node *n1;
    Node *n2;
    Edge *reverse;
    int original;
    int residual;
};
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>

Nodes are pretty simple.  They have names, and adjacency lists.  For now, we will represent
the adjacency lists with vectors.  Nodes also have a <b>visited</b> field, which helps us when
we use DFS to find paths.
<p>
Edges are a little meatier.  They have names, and pointers to the nodes that they connect.
We store their original capacities and their residual capacities.  If we wanted to maintain
flow, we could do that too.  However, I'm not doing that, simply to keep the program cleaner.
When you do your lab, you're going to need to maintain the flow.
<p>
Each edge has a pointer to its reverse edge.  This simplifies the task of processing the
residual graph.  I'm going to make sure that each edge always has a reverse edge, regardless of 
whether that reverse edge really exists in the residual graph.  
If the reverse edge really doesn't exist, I'm going to create it anyway, and give it an
original and residual capacity of zero.  When I "remove" an edge from the residual graph,
I simply set its residual capacity to zero.
<p>
In this initial implementation, I'm going to have all edges go onto their nodes' adjacency 
lists, regardless of whether their capacities are zero.  That makes the programming easier to
begin with.  We'll fix this later.  
<p>
Finally, each edge has a name and a <b>Print()</b> method, which is useful, because there are
several places where we print out edges.
<p>
You'll note, we're keeping pointers to nodes and edges.  This is because there are several different
places where we want to access nodes and edges, and to avoid making copies, we have exactly one copy
of each node and edge, and we manipulate pointers to them.
<p>
Here is the definition of the <b>Graph</b> class:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Graph {
  public:
     Graph();
     ~Graph();
     string Verbose;   /* G = print graph at each step. P = print paths.  B = Basic */
     void Print();

     int NPaths;
     int MaxCap;
     Node *Source;
     Node *Sink;

     vector &lt;Node *&gt; Nodes; 
     vector &lt;Edge *&gt; Edges; 
     map &lt;string, Node *&gt; N_Map;
     map &lt;string, Edge *&gt; E_Map;

     Node *Get_Node(string &s);
     Edge *Get_Edge(Node *n1, Node *n2);

     int MaxFlow();
     int Find_Augmenting_Path();
     int DFS(Node *n);
     vector &lt;Edge *&gt; Path;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

There's quite a bit here.  Let's get the simple things out of the way.  There is a constructor,
a destructor, and a <b>Print()</b> method.  
I keep a string <b>Verbose</b>, which lets me adjust what I print:  
<UL>
<LI> If the string has a <b>G</b>, then I'm going to print the residual 
graph before finding each augmenting path.
<LI> If the string has a <b>P</b>, then I'm going to print each augmenting path.
<LI> If the string has a <b>B</b>, then I will print the graph at the beginning and the end.
<LI> I will always print the maximum flow and the number of augmenting paths found at the
  end of the program.
</UL>

I have variables to store the number of paths, the source, the sink, and the maximum capacity
that any edge in the graph can achieve.  This gives me a sentinel for flow calculations.  
<p>
The next four fields are how I hold nodes and edges.  I have a vector, which enables me to
easily access every node and edge, and I have a map, which I only use when I'm reading in
the file.  The map lets me look up nodes and edges by name.
<p>
<b>Get_Node()</b> and <b>Get_Edge()</b> are really convenient procedures.  They look up the
node or edge in the relevant map, and if it's there, they return a pointer.  If it's not there, then
they create it, insert it into map, and return it.  
<p>
The last three methods and <b>Path</b> are for doing the network flow calculation.
<hr>
<h3>Reading in the Graph</h3>

As always, reading in the graph is a bit of a pain.  First, here are 
<b>Get_Node()</b> and <b>Get_Edge()</b>.  They are straghtforward:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td valign=top><pre>
Node *Graph::Get_Node(string &s)
{
  Node *n;

  if (N_Map.find(s) != N_Map.end()) return N_Map[s];

  n = new Node;
  n-&gt;name = s;
  n-&gt;visited = 0;
  N_Map[s] = n;
  Nodes.push_back(n);
  return n;
}
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
Edge *Graph::Get_Edge(Node *n1, Node *n2)
{
  string en;
  Edge *e;

  en = n1-&gt;name + "-&gt;";
  en += n2-&gt;name;

  if (E_Map.find(en) != E_Map.end()) return E_Map[en];
  e = new Edge;
  e-&gt;name = en;
  E_Map[en] = e;
  Edges.push_back(e);
  e-&gt;original = 0;
  e-&gt;residual = 0;
  e-&gt;n1 = n1;
  e-&gt;n2 = n2;
  e-&gt;reverse = NULL;
  return e;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The only real subtlety here is that I don't create reverse edges in <b>Get_Edge()</b>.
Instead, I do it in the graph constructor.  
<p>
The graph constructor is also straightforward.  I'll include the code here, but I'm not going to
explain it much:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Graph::Graph()
{
  string s, nn, nn2, en;
  int cap, i;
  Node *n1, *n2;
  Edge *e, *r, *tmp;

  MaxCap = 0;
  Source = NULL;
  Sink = NULL;

  while (cin &gt;&gt; s) {
    if (s == "SOURCE" || s == "SINK") {
      if (!(cin &gt;&gt; nn)) exit(0);
      n1 = Get_Node(nn);
      if (s == "SOURCE") {
        if (Source != NULL) { cerr &lt;&lt; "Two sources.\n"; exit(1); }
        Source = n1;
      } else {
        if (Sink != NULL) { cerr &lt;&lt; "Two sinks.\n"; exit(1); }
        Sink = n1;
      }
    } else if (s == "EDGE") {
      if (!(cin &gt;&gt; nn &gt;&gt; nn2 &gt;&gt; cap)) exit(0);
      if (cap &lt;= 0) exit(0);

      n1 = Get_Node(nn);
      n2 = Get_Node(nn2);
      e = Get_Edge(n1, n2);
      e-&gt;original += cap;
      e-&gt;residual += cap;
      if (e-&gt;residual &gt; MaxCap) MaxCap = cap + 1;
       
      if (e-&gt;reverse == NULL) {  /* This means that the edge was just created */
        r = Get_Edge(n2, n1);
        e-&gt;reverse = r;
        r-&gt;reverse = e;
        n1-&gt;adj.push_back(e);
        n2-&gt;adj.push_back(r);
      }
    }
  }
  MaxCap *= 2;        /* This is because you can add flow in both directions (just trust me) */
  if (Source == NULL) { cerr &lt;&lt; "No Source.\n"; exit(1); }
  if (Sink == NULL) { cerr &lt;&lt; "No Sink.\n"; exit(1); }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When I call <b>Get_Edge()</b>, I check <b>reverse</b> to see if it's NULL.  If it is, then
I have just created the edge for the first time.  That is when I create the reverse edge, and
put both of them on their respective adjacency lists.
<p>
I also have a destructor, which deletes all of the nodes and edges.  This is good form, because
if I create an instance of a graph and then delete it, all of the memory associated with
the graph will be released:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
Graph::~Graph()
{
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; Nodes.size(); i++) delete Nodes[i];
  for (i = 0; i &lt; Edges.size(); i++) delete Edges[i];
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>Print()</b> method prints each node and its adjacency list, showing the name and 
residual flow on each edge.  And the <b>main()</b> simply reads the graph and prints it
if <b>Verbose</b> contains a 'B'.  Here are both:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td><pre>
void Edge::Print()
{
  printf("[%s:%d]", name.c_str(), residual);
}

void Graph::Print()
{
  int i, j;
  Node *n;

  printf("Graph:\n");
  for (i = 0; i &lt; Nodes.size(); i++) {
    n = Nodes[i];
    printf("  ");
    printf("Node: %s - ", n-&gt;name.c_str());
    for (j = 0; j &lt; n-&gt;adj.size(); j++) n-&gt;adj[j]-&gt;Print();
    printf("\n");
  }
}
</pre></td>
<td><pre>
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  Graph *G;
  int f;

  if (argc &gt; 2) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "usage: netflow verbosity(BGP) - graph on stdin\n";
    exit(1);
  }

  G = new Graph();

  if (argc == 2) G-&gt;Verbose = argv[1];
  if (G-&gt;Verbose.find('B') != string::npos) G-&gt;Print();

  delete G;   /* Doing this just to make sure that the destructor works */
}
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>
<hr>

With all of these pieces in place, let's print out the graphs in <b>g1.txt</b>
and <b>g5.txt</b>:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>netflow_skeleton B < g1.txt</b></font>

  Node: D - [D->C:0][D->T:12]

  Node: t - [t->n00:0][t->n01:0]
  Node: n00 - [n00->t:4923][n00->n01:0][n00->n02:6932][n00->n03:6518][n00->n04:6183]
  Node: n01 - [n01->n00:8824][n01->t:8471][n01->n02:0][n01->n03:0][n01->n04:6661]
  Node: n02 - [n02->n00:0][n02->n01:4929][n02->s:0][n02->n03:741][n02->n04:0]
  Node: n03 - [n03->n00:0][n03->n01:5566][n03->n02:0][n03->n04:0]
  Node: n04 - [n04->n00:0][n04->n01:0][n04->n02:5840][n04->n03:4417][n04->s:0]
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Again, every edge has a reverse edge, and these edges are stored on the adjacency lists.

<hr>
<h3>Calculating the Maximum Flow</h3>

The program
<b><a href=src/netflow_dfs_v_no_delete.cpp>src/netflow_dfs_v_no_delete.cpp</a></b>
is the simplest implementation that calculates the maximum flow. 
This program implements the three  methods that were left unimplemented
in the skeleton program.
The first of these is <b>MaxFlow()</b>, which simply calls the 
<b>Find_Augmenting_Path()</b> repeatedly, until no more augmenting paths may be found.
<b>MaxFlow()</b> is the simplest of the three methods:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Graph::MaxFlow()
{
  int mf, f;

  NPaths = 0;
  mf = 0;
  while (1) {
    f = Find_Augmenting_Path();
    mf += f;
    if (f == 0) return mf;
    NPaths++;
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The next method is <b>Find_Augmenting_Path()</b>. This calls <b>DFS()</b> to find
an augmenting path from <b>Source</b> to <b>Sink</b>.  <b>DFS()</b> returns 1 if it
succeeds and 0 if it fails.  If it succeeds, the path is in the vector <b>Path</b>.
The order of the edges in <b>Path</b> should be immaterial here -- as long as all of the
edges are in the vector, then <b>Find_Augmenting_Path()</b> can process it.  As it turns
out, <b>DFS</b> and all of the other implementations have the edges in reverse order.
Fortunately, that's not important.  

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Graph::Find_Augmenting_Path()
{
  int i, f;
  Edge *e;

  <font color=blue>/* Clear visited fields, and the path. Then find an augmenting path with DFS. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; Nodes.size(); i++) Nodes[i]-&gt;visited = 0;
  Path.clear();
  if (Verbose.find('G') != string::npos) Print();
  if (DFS(Source)) {

    <font color=blue>/* Calculate the flow through the path */</font>

    f = MaxCap;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; Path.size(); i++) {
      if (Path[i]-&gt;residual &lt; f) f = Path[i]-&gt;residual;
    }

    <font color=blue>/* The path is in reverse order, so we print the vector from back to front */</font>

    if (Verbose.find('P') != string::npos) {
      printf("Path with flow %d: ", f);
      for (i = Path.size()-1; i &gt;= 0; i--) Path[i]-&gt;Print();
      printf("\n");
    }

    <font color=blue>/* Process the residual Graph */</font>

    for (i = 0; i &lt; Path.size(); i++) {
      e = Path[i];
      e-&gt;residual -= f;
      e-&gt;reverse-&gt;residual += f;
    }

    return f;
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

After finding a path, <b>Find_Augmenting_Path()</b> does three things.  First, it 
calculates the flow, then it optionally prints the path, and last, it processes the
residual graph, removing flow from the forward direction and adding it to the reverse
direction.  This is all straightfoward, because we don't bother deleting edges with 
zero residual capacity from the adjacency lists.  

<p>
All that's left is to find an augmenting path.  Here is the depth-first search. 
It is a straightforward recursive DFS.  The only important thing is that we need to ignore
zero capacity edges, because we want to find paths with flow:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Graph::DFS(Node *n)
{
  int i;
  Edge *e;

  if (n-&gt;visited) return 0;
  if (n == Sink) return 1;
  n-&gt;visited = 1;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; n-&gt;adj.size(); i++) {
    e = n-&gt;adj[i];
    if (e-&gt;residual != 0) {
      if (DFS(e-&gt;n2)) {
        Path.push_back(e);
        return 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We create the path whenever a recursive call returns 1.  In other words, we create it when
we have actually found a path to the sink.
<p>
Let's see how this works on our example graph, which I'll reproduce below:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td> <b><a href=g1.txt>g1.txt</a></b>:<pre>
SOURCE S
SINK T
EDGE A B 5
EDGE A T 5
EDGE B T 8
EDGE C B 13
EDGE C D 10
EDGE D T 12
EDGE S A 10
EDGE S C 14
</pre></td>
<td> <b><a href=g1a.txt>g1a.txt</a></b>:<pre>

EDGE C D 10
EDGE B T 8
EDGE A B 5
EDGE C B 13
</pre></td>
<td><img src=img/E1-1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Because these two graph files create adjacency lists in different orders, they 
find different paths when calculating the maximum flow.  The flow in both graphs 
is the same, however.

It is not a bad idea for you to process these paths yourself to reinforce how to process
the residual graph.  To help you, you can run the program with "PG", and that lets you see
the residual graph at each stage of the calculation.

<h3>How to represent adjacency lists?</h3>

The representation of the adjacency list has a profound impact on the performance of
Network Flow.  The solution above was easy to code.  However, keeping zero edges on the
adjacency list is going to slow down our DFS.  On the flip side, deleting edges from the
adjacency lists will incur its own overhead.  Not to mention, it makes the programming 
harder.  I have five different implementations, and although I'm not going to go over the
code specifically with you, the code is there so that you can answer your own questions:

<UL>
<LI> <a href=src/netflow_dfs_v_no_delete.cpp><b>src/netflow_dfs_v_no_delete.cpp</b></a>:  This is the version above.
<p><LI> <a href=src/netflow_dfs_v_delete.cpp><b>src/netflow_dfs_v_delete.cpp</b></a>: In this version, I delete zero edges from the
adjacency lists.  I don't delete the <b>Edge</b> class though, which means that 
each edge will have a valid reverse edge.  It just so happens that if the reverse edge has
zero residual capacity, it is not on an adjacency list.
<p>
To delete edges, I have each edge store an integer <b>index</b>, which is the index of the 
edge in the adjacency list.  When you delete an edge, what you do is first swap it with 
the last edge in the node's adjacency list (adjusting that node's <b>index</b>).  Then you 
call <b>pop_back()</b> to delete the edge from the adjacency list.  I do this because it makes
deletion constant time.  What I don't want to do is, for example, move every edge over and then
reside the vector, because that is not a constant time action.
<p><LI> <a href=src/netflow_dfs_list_pf.cpp><b>src/netflow_dfs_list_pf.cpp</b></a>: 
In this version, I use a <b>list</b> rather than a vector for the adjacency list.  
Instead of storing an <b>index</b>, I store the iterator to the edge on the list, in the 
variable <b>pointer</b>.  This lets me delete easily using the <b>erase()</b> method, which is
constant time on lists.  
<p>
There is an interesting implementational issue arising from (in my opinion) bad design of the
STL.  Because <b>push_back()</b> doesn't return an iterator to the new node (like it should), 
and because <b>rbegin()</b> returns a <b>reverse_iterator</b>, I use <b>push_front()</b> whenever
I put a new edge onto an adjacency list.  This is because I can now grab its iterator easily
with <b>begin()</b>.
<p><LI> <a href=src/netflow_dfs_list_pb.cpp><b>src/netflow_dfs_list_pb.cpp</b></a>: 
This is identical to the last version, but now I am calling <b>push_back()</b>, and grabbing
the iterator by calling <b>end()</b> and then decrementing.  This ends up being quite a
significant change.
<p><LI> <a href=src/netflow_dfs_edge_list.cpp><b>src/netflow_dfs_edge_list.cpp</b></a>: 
Only read this code if you want to torture yourself.  Because <b>push_back()</b> and <b>erase()</b>
have some overhead to them, what I did here was implement a class called an <b>EdgeList</b>, 
which stores an adjacency list, but makes sure that the zero capacity edges are at the end.
When you set an edge's capacity to zero, you swap it with the last non-zero capacity edge.
I thought this may be more efficient than <b>src/netflow_dfs_v_delete.cpp</b>, because it eliminates
all of the <b>push_back()</b> and <b>pop_backs()</b>.  Functionally, it is 
equivalent to <b>src/netflow_dfs_v_delete.cpp</b>.
</UL>

When you run these on a big graph, the results are stunningly not what you'd think.  Here
are timings on my MacbookPro (2.4 Ghz Intel Core i5 processor - I got the machine in 2011 or so) on 
<b><a href=g200.txt>g200.txt</a></b>, which is a graph with 200 interior nodes:

First, they all find the same flow of 316197.  Yay.
Now, in terms of the two programs that use vectors, the one that deletes nodes is
far preferable to the one that doesn't.  That's because all of those zero capacity edges
on the adjacency lists take up time in <b>DFS()</b>.  The "Edge List" does a worse job
than simply calling <b>pop_back()</b>, so we don't have to worry about that one any more.
(also Yay).
<p>
What about the two <b>list</b> implementations -- that is amazing, isn't it?  The one that
calls <b>push_front()</b> took nearly 12 seconds, and the one that calls <b>push_back()</b>
took the shortest amount of time of any of the implementations: Just 0.361 seconds.
<p>
The reason why has nothing to do with how the data structures are implemented.  Instead, it
has to do with the number of paths that are generated.  The <b>push_front()</b> version 
generated 205,014 paths, while the <b>push_back()</b> version generated just 5,389.  The other
versions generated roughly 40,000 each.   I want you to think about why the <b>push_front()</b>
version generates lots of paths, and why the <b>push_back()</b>
version generates few.  It has to do with the fact that when you process a graph and you 
add an edge to an adjacency list, the edge is likely to have a small amount of capacity.  
So, if you put it in the front of a list, then you're more likely to find a new path with small
flow rather than large.  And small flow edges are bad (remember the pathelogical example from
the first set of lecture notes).
<p>
Now, if you divide the running times by the number of paths, then you get
0.000038 seconds per path with <b>netflow_dfs_v_delete</b>, and 
0.000067 seconds per path with <b>netflow_dfs_list_pb</b>.  So using a vector and deleting
is the fastest way to process paths, when you normalize by the number of paths.  We are
therefore going to use 
<b>src/netflow_dfs_v_delete.cpp</b> as our starting point for the remaining implementations.
