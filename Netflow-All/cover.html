As of November, 2014, I have cleaned up and unified my lecture notes for Network Flow.
They are broken into the following files:

<UL>
<LI> <b><a href=lecture-1.html>Lecture 1:</a></b> Augmenting Paths, Minimum Cuts, A Pathelogical Example
<LI> <b><a href=lecture-2.html>Lecture 2:</a></b> Programming the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm with DFS
<LI> <b><a href=lecture-3.html>Lecture 3:</a></b> Different Ways of Finding the Augmenting Paths (including Edmonds-Karp)
<LI> <b><a href=extra-lecture.html>Supplemental Lecture:</a></b> Some extra help with Network Flow
<LI> <b><a href=https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/maximum-flow-section-1/>The Topcoder Tutorial on Network Flow:</a></b> Section 2 of this Tutorial discusses uses of Network Flow.  This is an excellent tutorial, and I want you to read all of section 2.  The section on bipartite matching
is very important for your Network Flow lab.

In CS494, I do a segment on four really interesting Topcoder problems 
that feature Network Flow.  <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs494/494/notes/General_Network_Flow/index.html>Here are the lecture notes for those four problems</a>.
