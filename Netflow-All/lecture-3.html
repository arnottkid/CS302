The last piece of the Network Flow puzzle is doing a better job of finding augmenting
paths.  Both of the previous sets of lecture notes have highlighted the importance of finding
good paths to reduce the number of paths that you find.  One way to do this is to try to 
find paths with a lot of flow.  That gets you closer to your maximum flow more quickly, and
therefore reduces the number of paths that you find.
<p>
<h3>Ordering the edges in DFS (sometimes called "Greedy DFS")</h3>

The first thing that I tried was to modify my list implementation to use a multimap instead
of a list for the adjacency lists.  The multimap is keyed on the residual capacity, and
therefore, you are doing the <b>DFS()</b> in a greedy manner -- always traversing adjacency 
lists in decreasing order of edge capacity.  The program is in 
<b><a href=netflow_dfs_greedy.cpp>netflow_dfs_greedy.cpp</a></b>.  
Let's see how it runs on our favorite two graphs:

You should confirm the first paths in each of these graphs.  Since edge <i>SC</i> has the
largest capacity, that is the first one tried in the DFS.  Then, since <i>CB</i> is C's
largest edge, that is tried next, and since <i>BT</i> is B's only edge, that is the one that
gets you to the sink.  This is not the path with the largest flow (that is <i>SCDT</i>, but
since the edge <i>CB</i> has bigger capacity than edge <i>CD</i>, it is processed first in the
DFS.
<p>
Think about the cost tradeoffs of this algorithm versus a regular depth-first search.
When you're processing the path, you are going to be doing insertions and deletions in 
the adjacency multimaps.  Those are logarithmic time operations rather than constant time,
so that will be slower than the regular DFS.  We are hoping that the fewer number of paths
will compensate.  
<p>
Let's try the big 200-node graph:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time netflow_dfs_greedy < g200.txt</b></font>
Max flow is 316197 - Paths: 108
0.217u 0.009s 0:00.22 95.4%	0+0k 0+1io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

We have a winner!  This beats all of our other DFS-based approaches.

<h3>Finding the Maximum Flow Path at each Iteration (Modified Dijkstra)</h3>

But we can do better.  How about finding the augmenting path with the maximum flow at each
step.  That's something that we can't do with depth-first-search, but we can modify Dijkstra's
shortest path algorithm to achieve the goal.  Recall Dijkstra's algorithm.  At each step, you
have a collection of nodes for which you know the shortest path.  What you do is find the shortest
path to the closest node that is not in this set, and add it to the set.  
<p>
You can do the same thing with flow.  You maintain a set of nodes where you know the maximum flow
to each of those nodes.  Then you add the node that is not in the set, 
that has the highest flow to that set.  
<p>
Let's put it another way -- with Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, you maintain a multiset of
nodes ordered by the shortest paths to the nodes.  Instead, you are going to maintain a multiset
of nodes ordered by the maximum flow to the nodes.  It works in the same way.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=netflow_dijkstra.cpp>netflow_dijkstra.cpp</a></b>.  This is the same as
<b><a href=netflow_dfs_v_delete.cpp>netflow_dfs_v_delete.cpp</a></b>, but instead of <b>DFS()</b>,
we have a method called <b>Dijkstra()</b>, which finds the maximum flow path.  Below, I
show the new <b>Node</b> variables to implement Dijsktra's algorithm and the <b>Dijkstra()</b>
algorithm:

As before, let's see it running on our two example graphs:

<pre>

Path with flow 5: [S->A:5][A->B:5][B->T:8]
Path with flow 3: [S->C:4][C->B:13][B->T:3]
Max flow is 23 - Paths: 4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>netflow_dijkstra P < g5.txt</b></font>
Path with flow 4929: [s->n02:6263][n02->n01:4929][n01->t:8471]
Path with flow 4417: [s->n04:8033][n04->n03:4417][n03->n01:5566][n01->n00:8824][n00->t:4923]
Path with flow 741: [s->n04:3616][n04->n02:5840][n02->n03:741][n03->n01:1149][n01->t:3542]
Max flow is 10087 - Paths: 3
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

As you see, with <b>g1.txt</b>, the output differs from the greedy DFS, because this one actually
finds the maximum flow path at each step.  Interestingly, with <b>g5.txt</b>, the two produce
paths with the same flow, but the paths are different. 
<p>
When we try it on the 200-node graph, we get the best time yet, with just 76 paths:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time netflow_dijkstra < g200.txt </b></font>
Max flow is 316197 - Paths: 76
0.154u 0.008s 0:00.47 31.9%	0+0k 0+1io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

As with the greedy DFS, let's think about the tradeoffs of this algorithm  With greedy DFS,
we made processing the residual more expensive, because you had to insert and delete edges
from the adjacency multimaps.  Here, processing the residual is back to being cheap, involving
constant time operations.  The expense is in finding the paths, which is <i>O(|E|log|V|)</i> at
each step, rather than <i>O(|E|)</i>.  To compensate for that expense, we are finding far fewer
paths, since we find the maximum flow path at each step.

<hr>
<h3>The Edmonds-Karp Algorithm: Using BFS to find the path</h3>

Our last path-finding algorithm is interesting.  What we do is find the shortest <i>unweighted</i>
path at each iteration.  In other words, we find the path with the fewest number of edges.  We
do this with breadth-first search, which is <i>O(|E|)</i> rather than the <i>O(|E|log|V|)</i> of
Dijkstra's algorithm.  The hope is that we still have a small number of paths, but now our path
finding algorithm is faster.
<p>
This is called the "Edmonds-Karp" algorithm, and its overall running time is <i>(|V||E|<sup>2</sup>)</i>.
<p>
I don't show the program that implements it, 
because that's what you are going to implement in your lab.  However, it is easier than
the previous program, since it is a simply BFS.  Here it
is on our two example graphs:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>netflow_edmonds_karp P < g1.txt</b></font>
Path with flow 5: [S->A:10][A->T:5]
Path with flow 5: [S->A:5][A->B:5][B->T:8]
Path with flow 3: [S->C:14][C->B:13][B->T:3]
Path with flow 10: [S->C:11][C->D:10][D->T:12]
Max flow is 23 - Paths: 4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>netflow_edmonds_karp P < g5.txt</b></font>
Path with flow 4929: [s->n02:6263][n02->n01:4929][n01->t:8471]
Path with flow 741: [s->n02:1334][n02->n03:741][n03->n01:5566][n01->t:3542]
Path with flow 2801: [s->n04:8033][n04->n03:4417][n03->n01:4825][n01->t:2801]
Path with flow 1616: [s->n04:5232][n04->n03:1616][n03->n01:2024][n01->n00:8824][n00->t:4923]
Max flow is 10087 - Paths: 4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The algorithm is interesting because it works on the structure of the graph rather than its
flow, but in doing so, improves the number of paths drastically from DFS.  
Here it is on the big, 200-node graph.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time netflow_edmonds_karp < g200.txt</b></font>
Max flow is 316197 - Paths: 176
0.134u 0.008s 0:00.14 92.8%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Interesting, no?  More paths, but faster path-finding make for a (slightly) faster algorithm.

<hr>
<h3>The big comparison</h3>

Let's put it all together, and compare the 8 implementations.  The graph below is 
from a pretty old machine -- I'm guessing a 2010 Intel processor.  
In this graph, I'm repeatedly picking a seed, and then using that seed to 
call <b>makerandom</b> for graph sizes between 5 and 375.  I then run each of the eight 
implementations on the graphs.  In this graph, I've done the tests roughly 1,000 times.

<p><center><table border=3><td><a href=Speed.jpg><img src=Speed.jpg width=600></a></td></table></center><p>

Ok, I lied above -- I stopped running some of the implementations (e.g. <b>netflow_dfs_list_pf</b>)
above a certain graph size, because it's pretty obvious how they are scaling.
The trends follow the explanation above.  The three path-finding algorithms described in this
lecture perform the best, and there's no real clear winner between the modified Dijkstra and
Edmonds-Karp.  It is interesting that the Edmonds-Karp curve is less jaggedy than the 
modified Dijkstra.  Perhaps you can come up with a good explanation for that.  It has to 
do with the structure of the graph.
<p>
Now take a look at the average number of augmenting paths processed by each algorithm:

<p><center><table border=3><td><a href=Paths.jpg><img src=Paths.jpg width=600></a></td></table></center><p>

This is as we would expect.  With the exception of the greedy DFS, the DFS algorithms generate
way too many paths, as they don't put any effort into finding smart paths.  The other three algorithms do a <i>much</i>
better job at reducing the number of paths.  
<p>
BTW, you can't see the curve for <b>netflow_dfs_edge_list</b>, because it is identical
to <b>netflow_dfs_v_delete</b>.
<p>
Is it surprising to you that Edmonds-Karp runs so fast, yet is the worst of the three in terms
of number of paths?  It shouldn't be -- remember the running times of the various components:
