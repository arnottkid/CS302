<h3>Clicker Question on Doing DFS with a Stack</h3>

In the following picture, I give you the adjacency lists
of an undirected graph, plus a suggested layout of the
nodes.  

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/click-DFS.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Here are two exam questions that I could see myself
asking:

<p>
1. Suppose I call DFS(J).  Which node is visited first:
K or B?
<p>
2. Suppose I print out the name of each node, the first time
that it is visited after I call <b>DFS(J)</b>.  What will
be printed (print a 10-character word, with no spaces, like 
"JBFNCKMGAD")?   I suggest that you maintain a stack
and a "visited" vector, and then instead of doing recursion, you push nodes from the
adjacency list in reverse order.  You don't even have to draw
the graph for this problem.
