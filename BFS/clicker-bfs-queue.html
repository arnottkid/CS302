<h3>Clicker Question on Doing BFS with a Queue</h3>

Here's the same undirected graph as in the DFS clicker question:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/click-DFS-ans.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Please answer the following three questions.  They are related, so you should answer
all of them, and then put your answers into the clicker at the end.
<p>
What I want to you do is a BFS from node J.  In doing the BFS, I want you to maintain
four things:

<UL>
<LI> The queue of nodes that is central to the BFS.
<LI> The order in which nodes were visited.
<LI> The shortest distance from J to each node.
<LI> For each node <i>n</i>, which node put <i>n</i> onto the queue?  In the lecture notes,
     I use a backedge for this -- if node <i>y</i> put node <i>n</i> onto the queue, then
     we store edge <i>(y,n)</i> on the queue.  Instead of a backedge, we're simply going to 
     store the <i>y</i> nodes for each node <i>n</i>.   For node J, since we use it to start
     the BFS, we'll just store an "X" here.
</UL>

I want to you return three things, one in each clicker question:

<hr>
1. Print out the order in which the nodes were visited, as a single 10-character word.
<p>
<hr>
2. Print out the distance vector.  For example, 
For example, we'll start by processing nodes J and C.  At this point,
the distance vector will be:

<pre>
A B C D F G J K M N 
- - 1 - - - 0 - - - 
</pre>

If we printed out the vector, we would print: <tt>"--1---0---"</tt>.
For this question, please print the final distance vector (again, as a single 10-character word).
<p>
<hr>
3. What is the "backedge" vector.  Again, we're storing nodes in that vector.
For example, when we start by pushing node J on the queue, we'll put an "X" there to represent
its backedge, because the BFS starts with J.  Here's what it will look like:

<pre>
A B C D F G J K M N 
- - - - - - X - - - 
</pre>

Node J will push nodes C and B onto the queue, and now our backedge vector will be:

<pre>
A B C D F G J K M N 
- J J - - - X - - - 
</pre>

At the end of the BFS, what is this vector.  Again, print a 10-character string.

<hr>
The following is a nice thing to cut-and-paste into your editor to help you work through
the problem.  

<pre>
Order: 
Queue: 

           A B C D F G J K M N 
Distances: - - - - - - - - - -
Backedges: - - - - - - - - - -
</pre>
