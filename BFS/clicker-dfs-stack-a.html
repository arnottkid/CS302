<h3>Clicker Question on Doing DFS with a Stack</h3>

Here's the graph with the edges drawn:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/click-DFS-ans.jpg></td></table></center><p>

1. Suppose I call DFS(J).  Which node is visited first:
K or B?
<p>
<i>Answer: The simplest thing is to draw in the edges as above.  Then, you can see from
adjacency lists that J will visit C first.  And you can see that the DFS will wind its
way from C to B via node K.  So the answer is K.  See the DFS below if you need to walk
through it more slowly.

2. Suppose I print out the name of each node, the first time
that it is visited after I call <b>DFS(J)</b>.  What will
be printed (print a 10-character word, with no spaces, like 
"JBFNCKMGAD")?   I suggest that you maintain a stack
and a "visited" vector.  You don't even have to draw
the graph for this problem.
<p>
<i>Answer: The cleanest way to work through the DFS is to maintain a stack, and
we'll push our children on in reverse order.  We'll also maintain a vector
of visited nodes, and our answer.  I have a video of the process
<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agCxf4U_7BU>here</a>.  As you'll see, the answer is <b>JCGKBFNMAD</b>.
