I have a program that takes two command line arguments, n and m.  It creates the vector r to have 2m elements in it, and it creates p as a map that contains half of the elements of r.  It then calls find_em().  When I call it with n = 10,000,000 and m = 1,000, it takes 2.8 seconds to run. 
<p>
How long will it take when I call it with n = 20,000,000 and m = 1,000?

<table><td valign=top>
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int find_em(const vector &lt;int&gt; &r,
            const map &lt;int, int&gt; &p,
            int n) 
{
  int found;
  int i, index;

  found = 0;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
    index = rand() % r.size();
    if (p.find(r[index]) != p.end()) found++;
  }
  return found;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b>Answer:</b>
Since the loop is <i>O(n log(m))</i> (it's the same loop as last class), we expect the time
to double when we double <i>n</i>.  The answer is 5.6.
<p>
I have the program in <b>src/click1.cpp</b> -- the time does roughly double:

g++ -std=c++98 -Wall -Wextra -Iinclude -o bin/click1 src/click1.cpp

<h3>Question 2</h3>

We're running the same program as the last question.  When n = 10,000,000 and m = 1,000, the program takes 2.8 seconds.  Roughly how long will it take when n = 10,000,000 and m = 2,000?

<p>
<b>Answer:</b>
The answer is a little trickier here.  We want to assess the impact of <i>log(2m)</i> in <i>O(n log(m))</i>.  Since the base of the logrhythm is two, <i>log(2m)</i> is equal to <i>log(m)+1</i>.
So the impact is not going to be great.  Were I estimating, I'd say that <i>log(1000)</i>
is roughly 10 (remember your powers of two -- 1024 is <i>2<sup>10</sup></i>), which means
that <i>log(2000)</i> is roughly 11.  So I would multiply 2.8 by 11/10 to get 
3.08.  I accepted any answer between 2.8001 and 3.5.
<p>
Again, it's not too far off:
