<h3>Reference Material Online</h3>

I used to point you to Wikipedia, but that is too dominated by theoreticians, who are more worried about completeness than readability.  <a href=https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/introduction-to-graphs-and-their-data-structures-section-1/>The
Topcoder tutorial on graphs and graph algorithms</a> is a great resource.  I suggest that you
read it through depth first search as reference material for this part of the class.
<p>
Wikipedia has a 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory>glossary of graph terms.</a>  
The terms you should know are the following: 
    vertices, edges, adjacency, incidence, directed/undirected, 
    path, cycle, loop, multiedge, connected component, bipartite.
<p>
Wikipedia also has some pages that are less dense mathematically, which you may also find useful.
Here is the page on <a href=http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory>graph theory</a>.

<h3>Graph Representations</h3>

There are infinite ways to represent graphs.  There are three main ways that you should know:

<UL>
<LI> Using adjacency lists.
<LI> Using an adjacency matrix.
<LI> Mathematically.
</UL>

The first two are how you typically represent a graph in a computer program.  We will go over
all three, plus some more below.

<hr>
<h3>Adjacency Lists</h3>

With <i>adjacency lists</i>,
for each node, you maintain a list of the nodes to which this node has edges.  This list can have a variety 
of elements, depending on what you're doing.  For example, if you are indexing nodes by numbers from zero
to the number of nodes minus one, then the list can simply be indices of nodes.  Sometimes the list will
have pointers to node structures.  And sometimes the list will contain structures corresponding to edges,
which will have more information.
<p>
Let's give some examples.  Here are two graphs, which we will call <b>G1</b> and <b>G2</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=10>
<td align=center><b>G1:</b><hr><IMG src=g1.jpg height=150></td>
<td align=center><b>G2:</b><hr><IMG src=g2.jpg height=150></td>
</table></center><p>

They are undirected graphs.  <b>G1</b> has four connected components and no cycles, while
<b>G2</b> has two connected components and one cycle.  Both graphs are bipartite: with 
<b>G1</b>, the two sets of nodes are { 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9 }, { 3, 4, 8 }.  Other partitionings
are possible (for example, nodes 0 and 2 can go into either set).  For <b>G2</b>, the
two sets are { 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 9 }, { 2, 3, 5, 6 }.  (You can put 4 into either set, 
but beyond that, the two sets are fixed).
<p>
Were we to add the edge (0, 1) to <b>G2</b>, it would no longer be bipartite.
<p>
If our adjacency lists contain indices of nodes, then the following table shows the adjacency list representation
of the graph:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<tr><td align=center><b>Node</b></td>
    <td align=center><b>Adjacency list in G1</b></td>
    <td align=center><b>Adjacency list in G2</b></td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>0</td>
     <td align=center>{}</td>
     <td align=center>{ 3 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>1</td>
     <td align=center>{ 3 }</td>
     <td align=center>{ 2 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>2</td>
     <td align=center>{}</td>
     <td align=center>{ 1, 9, 7 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>3</td>
     <td align=center>{ 1, 5 }</td>
     <td align=center>{ 0, 7 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>4</td>
     <td align=center>{ 6, 7, 9 }</td>
     <td align=center>{}</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>5</td>
     <td align=center>{ 3 }</td>
     <td align=center>{ 9, 7 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>6</td>
     <td align=center>{ 4, 8 }</td>
     <td align=center>{ 8 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>7</td>
     <td align=center>{ 4 }</td>
     <td align=center>{ 2, 5 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>8</td>
     <td align=center>{ 6 }</td>
     <td align=center>{ 5, 6 }</td></tr>
<tr> <td align=center>9</td>
     <td align=center>{ 4 }</td>
     <td align=center>{ 2, 5  }</td></tr>
</table></center><p>

With undirected graphs, we typically store each edge twice, which effectively makes the graph a directed graph.
That is what we have done above.  
<p>
You could, instead, have each node be its own data structure, and have each adjacency list be a vector of pointers
to nodes.  For example:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Node {
  public:
    int num;
    vector &lt;Node *&gt; adj;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Then, <b>G1</b> above would look as follows when it is stored in computer memory:

<p><center><a href=AdjList.jpg><table border=3><td><img src=AdjList.jpg width=500></td></table></a></center><p>

<hr>
<h3>Adjacency Matrices</h3>

With an adjacency matrix, a graph with <i>N</i> nodes is stored using an <i>N X N</i> matrix.  The matrix has one
row and column for every node in the graph, and the element at row <i>u</i> column <i>v</i> is set to one if there
is an edge from <i>u</i> to <i>v</i>.  If edges are weighted, you may store the weights there instead of zero or one.
<p>
Here are the adjacency matrices for the two example graphs:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td align=center><b>Adjacency Matrix for G1</b>
<pre>
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
 0 | 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 1 | 0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0
 2 | 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 3 | 0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0

</pre></td>
<td align=center><b>Adjacency Matrix for G2</b>

    -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
 0 | 0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0
 1 | 0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 2 | 0  1  0  0  0  0  0  1  0  1
 3 | 0  0  0  1  0  0  0  1  0  0
 4 | 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 5 | 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1  1
 6 | 0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0
 7 | 0  0  1  1  0  1  0  0  0  0
 8 | 0  0  0  0  0  1  1  0  0  0
 9 | 0  0  1  0  0  1  0  0  0  0
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Because this is an undirected graph, each edge has 
two entries in the adjacency matrix.  It also means that the adjacency matrices are symmetric
around the diagonal of the matrix.
<p>
If we let <i>|V|</i> be the number of nodes, and <i>|E|</i> be the number of edges (we'll see why
we use those terms later), then adjacency lists consume <i>O(|E|)</i> of memory, while
adjacency matrices consume <i>O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)</i> of memory.  For that reason, we typically use
adjacency matrices either when the graphs are so small that the size of the matrix doesn't matter, or when
the graph is very dense, which means that <i>|E| is O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)</i>, and the 
matrix and list representations use roughly the same amount of memory.

<hr>
<h3>Mathematical Representation</h3>

When computer scientists write about graphs, they often use a more mathematical representation.  
They typically define a graph as:
<p>
<center>
<i>G = { V, E }</i>
</center>
<p>
<i>V</i> is a set of vertices, and <i>E</i> is a set of edges.  (Yes, Wikipedia will tell you that technically, 
<i>E</i> is not a set, but that's one of those examples of Wikipedia pages being written by bored theoreticians.  For
now, call <i>E</i> a set.)  
<p>
Because they are sets, you denote the size of <i>V</i>, and therefore the number of vertices 
as <i>|V|</i>.  Similarly, the number of edges is <i>|E|</i>.
<p>
The specification of <i>V</i> and <i>E</i> defines the graph.  For example, here is a mathematical definition of <b>G1</b>:

<UL>
<LI> <i>V = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 }</i>
<LI> <i>E = { (1,3), (3,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,9), (6,8) }</i>
</UL>

and here is a mathematical definition of <b>G2</b>.  You'll note, I specify the set of vertices differently, but it
specifies the same set:

<UL>
<LI> <i>V = { i | 0 &le; i < 10 }</i>
<LI> <i>E = { (0,3), (1,2), (2,9), (2,7), (3,7), (7,5), (9,5), (5,8), (6,8) }</i>
</UL>

You'll also note that I only specified each edge once.  You must be told whether the graph is undirected or directed.
<p>
The mathematical representation can be very powerful, albeit a little terse and sometimes hard to read.  For example,
recall the binary heap implementation of priority queues (<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/PQ/>In the Priority Queue lecture notes</a>).  That
data may be viewed as a graph, as it's clear where the nodes and edges are.  Here's an example from that lecture:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=PQ.jpg></td></table></center><p>

This lends itself to a beautiful mathematical definition:

<UL>
<LI> <i>G = { V, E }</i>
<LI> <i>V = { i | 0 &leq; i < n }</i>
<LI> <i>E = { (u,v) | u,v &isin; V </i>and<i> v = 2u+1 </i>or<i> v = 2u+2 }</i>
<LI> For all <i>u &isin; V</i>, there is a numeric value <i>val(u)</i>.
<LI> If <i>(u,v) &isin; E</i>, then <i>val(u) &le; val(v)</i>.
</UL>

Granted, it's hard to read, but it packs a lot of information into a small amount of space!
The implementation that we did of priority queues also demonstrates that you can store certain
graphs without adjacency lists or matrices.  In that implementation, the only data structure we
used was a vector to hold the values.  We didn't need an adjacency list or matrix, because we
simply used math on the indices of the vector.  This is a by-product of priority queues having
such a specific form.

<hr>
<h3>Other Representations</h3>

As I said above, there are infinite ways to represent graphs.  When we implemented heaps, we were implementing 
a graph structure in an vector.  When we implemented disjoint sets, we were also implementing a graph structure; however,
since each node has exactly one link, we implemented all of the links for all of the nodes in a single vector.
<p>
When we implemented a maze in the disjoint set lecture, we were also implementing a graph.  However, that graph was 
represented by a list of walls, which is neither an adjacency list or matrix.  Instead, you can think of it as follows:
<UL>
<LI> Each cell of the maze is a node.
<LI> Each cell has four potential links -- up, down, left, right.
<LI> If a cell is on the top row of the maze, it doesn't have an up link.
<LI> If a cell is on the bottom row of the maze, it doesn't have a down link.
<LI> If a cell is on the left column of the maze, it doesn't have left link.
<LI> If a cell is on the right column of the maze, it doesn't have right link.
<LI> If a cell's link is in the list of walls, then that link doesn't exist.
</UL>

If you wanted to, you could build an adjacency list representation from the maze file, and when you go about solving the 
maze in your lab, that's probably the best thing to do for the DFS that solves the maze.

<hr>
<h3>File Representation</h3>

For the rest of this lecture, we are going to store graphs in a specific file format.  A file
representing a graph will start with a line "NNODES <i>n</i>," where <i>n</i> is the number of 
nodes in the graph.  Then the remaining lines are of the form "EDGE <i>from</i> <i>to</i>," where
<i>from</i> and <i>to</i> are numbers between 0 and <i>n-1</i>.  The files for <b>G1</b> and 
<b>G2</b> are below:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td valign=top>
<b><a href=g1.txt>g1.txt</a></b>
<pre>
NNODES 10
EDGE 4 9
EDGE 4 6
EDGE 4 7
EDGE 6 8
EDGE 3 5
EDGE 1 3
</pre></td>
<td valign=top>
<b><a href=g2.txt>g2.txt</a></b>
<pre>
NNODES 10
EDGE 5 9
EDGE 1 2
EDGE 5 8
EDGE 3 7
EDGE 2 7
EDGE 0 3
EDGE 5 7
EDGE 6 8
EDGE 2 9
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I can specify the edges in any order.
<hr>
<h3>Depth First Search</h3>

Depth-First Search (abbreviated "DFS") is one of the most basic graph algorithms.  With DFS, each node has a boolean value
called <i>visited</i>.  Before the DFS, that value is set to <b>false</b>, for all nodes.  Then, you commence a DFS on a node.
Let's call that node <i>n</i>.
The DFS works as follows:
<UL>
<LI> Check <i>n's</i> <i>visited</i> field.  If <b>true</b>, then return.
<LI> Set <i>n's</i> <i>visited</i> field to <b>true</b>.
<LI> Optionally do some activity on <i>n</i>.
<LI> Then, for all edges of the form <i>(n,u)</i> call DFS on <i>u</i>.
<LI> Optionally Do some final activity on <i>n</i>.
<LI> Return.
</UL>

When you call DFS on a node <i>n</i>, the DFS will visit every node connected to <i>n</i>.  For that reason, DFS
is good for activities that involve connectivity.  We'll see one of those in the next section.

<hr>
<h3>Depth First Search To Count Connected Components</h3>

Two nodes are in the same
connected component if there is a path between them.  Thus, a graph may be partitioned
into its connected components.  To discover all the nodes connected to a given node, you
can perform a depth first search on that node.  Thus, if you want to identify all of the
connected components of a graph, you can do that with one DFS for each component of the graph.
<p>
This results in the following algorithm for determining connected components.  First, you 
read in a graph.  Then you set all <i>visited</i> fields to zero.  Then you traverse
all the nodes in the graph, and whenever you encounter one whose <i>visited</i> field is
zero, you perform the connected component depth first search on it.  The total number
of depth first searches is equal to the number of connected components in the graph.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=concomp.cpp>concomp.cpp</a></b>.  (I have a second implementation which 
has pointers in the adjacency lists rather than integers, because sometimes I 
write that in class instead.  Please take a look at 
<a href=cc-pointer.html>this file</a> to see that program, and an explanation of
how it differs.)
<p>
In this program, we have separate classes for graphs and nodes.
Graphs contain a vector of nodes (pointers to nodes, really).  Each node has an adjacency list called 
<b>edges</b>, and this is a list of node numbers, as described above.  The DFS is called <b>Component_Count()</b>,
and it takes two parameters -- the node on which to perform the DFS (<i>n</i>), and the component number.  
The DFS uses a field <i>component</i> in each node as its <i>visited</i> field; however, instead of setting
it to <b>false</b> initially, it is set to -1.  And instead of setting it to <b>true</b> during the DFS, it
is set to the component number.
<p>
The code is below.  It is pretty straightforward:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

    int component;
};

  if (n-&gt;component != -1) return;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; n-&gt;edges.size(); i++) Component_Count(n-&gt;edges[i], cn);
}

As we can see, it works fine on our two example files.  Pay attention to the output.
Each line prints a node, its connected component number, and its adjacency list.
Make sure you understand the output and how it relates to the pictures.

The first call identifies the connected components as:
<UL>
<LI> Component 1: Node 0.
<LI> Component 2: Nodes 1, 3 and 5.
<LI> Component 3: Node 2.
<LI> Component 4: Nodes 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
</UL>

It's not a bad idea to copy this file over and put some print statements in
so that you can visualize the depth first search.
<p>
What's the running time?  <i>O(|V| + |E|)</i>.  This covers two cases:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> If there are more vertices than edges, then the running time is <i>O(|V|)</i>.
<LI> If there are more edges than vertices (recall that the number of edges can 
be as big as <i>|V|(|V|-1)//2</i>), then the running time is <i>O(|E|)</i>.
</UL>
Thus, we say that counting connected components is linear in the number of vertices and edges.
(We learned about connected components when we learned about disjoint sets too.  We can easily 
count connected components with disjoint sets, and the running time is <i>O(|E| &alpha;(|V|))</i>.
So, why would we ever use disjoint sets?  The answer is that sometimes the problem asks you to
do the connected component identification incrementally, and for that, disjoint sets are 
far superior to depth-first search.  Think about that.)
<hr>
<h3>Depth First Search To Perform Cycle Detection</h3>
<p>
Cycle detection is another depth first search.  Here we also 
set a <i>visited</i> field; however, if we now encounter a node
whose <i>visited</i> field is set, we know that the node is part 
of a cycle, and we return that fact.  Again, it's a simple search,
and I put the relevant code below
(in <b><a href=cycledet0.cpp>cycledet0.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Graph {
  public:
    vector &lt;Node *&gt; nodes;
    void Print();
    int is_cycle(int index);
};

int Graph::is_cycle(int index)
{
  Node *n;
  int i;

  n = nodes[index];
  if (n-&gt;visited) return 1;
  n-&gt;visited = 1;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; n-&gt;edges.size(); i++) {
    if (is_cycle(n-&gt;edges[i])) return 1;
  }
  return 0;
}

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ...

  for (i = 0; i &lt; g.nodes.size(); i++) {
    if (!g.nodes[i]-&gt;visited) {
      if (g.is_cycle(i)) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "There is a cycle reachable from node " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
      } else {
        cout &lt;&lt; "No cycle reachable from node " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
      }
    }
  }
}

Note that unlike connected components, this procedure has a return value,
and it uses that return value to truncate the search when a cycle is found.
<p>
When we run it, we see that it doesn't work correctly, as it says that
<b>g1</b> has a bunch of cycles, when we know that it doesn't:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cycledet0 < g1.txt</b></font>
No cycle reachable from node 0
There is a cycle reachable from node 1
No cycle reachable from node 2
There is a cycle reachable from node 4
There is a cycle reachable from node 6
There is a cycle reachable from node 7
There is a cycle reachable from node 8
UNIX> 
</pre>

Hmmm -- in 
<b><a href=cycledet1.cpp>cycledet1.cpp</a></b> I put a print statement at the
beginning of <b>is_cycle()</b>: 

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cycledet1 < g1.txt</b></font>
Called is_cycle(0)
No cycle reachable from node 0
Called is_cycle(1)
Called is_cycle(3)
Called is_cycle(5)
Called is_cycle(3)
There is a cycle reachable from node 1
...
</pre>

There's the bug.
The program first visits node 0 and finds no cycle.  Then
it visits node 1 and recursively visits nodes 3 and 5.  Since node 5 has an edge
back to node 3, it detects a cycle there.  How do we fix this bug?
<p>
One simple way is to include who calls <b>is_cycle()</b> as a parameter so that
<b>is_cycle()</b> will not detect cycles that include the same edge twice.  Here's
the changed procedure and call from <b>main()</b> in 
<b><a href=cycledet2.cpp>cycledet2.cpp</a></b>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Graph::is_cycle(int index, int from)
{
  Node *n;
  int i;

  n = nodes[index];
  if (n-&gt;visited) return 1;
  n-&gt;visited = 1;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; n-&gt;edges.size(); i++) {
    if (n-&gt;edges[i] != from) {
      if (is_cycle(n-&gt;edges[i], index)) return 1;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  ...
  for (i = 0; i &lt; g.nodes.size(); i++) {
    if (!g.nodes[i]-&gt;visited) {
      if (g.is_cycle(i, -1)) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "There is a cycle reachable from node " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
      } else {
        cout &lt;&lt; "No cycle reachable from node " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
      }

    }
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

All works well now:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cycledet2 < g1.txt</b></font>
No cycle reachable from node 0
No cycle reachable from node 1
No cycle reachable from node 2
No cycle reachable from node 4
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cycledet2 < g2.txt</b></font>
There is a cycle reachable from node 0
No cycle reachable from node 4
UNIX> 
</pre>

If you want to print the cycle, then you can start from when you first detect the cycle,
and then stop when you reach the node from whence you detected the cycle.  That's
in <b><a href=cycledet3.cpp>cycledet3.cpp</a></b>.  Note, when I detect the cycle,
I set the <b>visited</b> field to two.  That is how I know when to stop printing
and exit the program:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Graph::is_cycle(int index, int from)
{
  Node *n;
  int i;
  int rv;

  n = nodes[index];
  if (n-&gt;visited) {
    n-&gt;visited = 2;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Cycle: " &lt;&lt; index;
    return 1;
  }
  n-&gt;visited = 1;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; n-&gt;edges.size(); i++) {
    if (n-&gt;edges[i] != from) {
      if (is_cycle(n-&gt;edges[i], index)) {
        cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; index;
        if (n-&gt;visited == 2) {
          cout &lt;&lt; endl;
          exit(1);
        }
        return 1;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
}

<h3>Generating Random Graphs</h3>

I don't go over this in class, but read it if you're interested.
<p>
For some of our examples, we are going to generate random undirected graphs.  This
is a relatively simple matter, but does take a little care.  First, think
about a file format format for our graphs.  A simple format is to first specify 
the number of nodes and assume that the nodes are labeled with numbers from zero
to the number of nodes minus one.  Then we specify the edges by specifying the 
two nodes that each edge connects.  That specification makes it easy to write
code to read 
the graph, since you can allocate all the nodes after reading the first line.
<p>
There are other ways, of course, to represent graphs, which you will see in subsequent lectures
and labs.
<p>
Our graph generation program <b>gen_graph</b> takes two arguments: number of nodes and
number of edges, and then it emits the number of nodes and generates the appropriate
number of random edges.  There are two pitfalls in writing <b>gen_graph</b>.  First is
that you don't want to generate edges from a node to itself, and second is that you 
don't want to generate duplicate edges.  The first pitfall is taken care of easily by 
checking to make sure that the second random node generated does not equal the first.
<p>
To address the second pitfall, we use a <b>set</b>.  When we generate a random edge,
we turn it into a string composed of the id of the smaller node followed by a space
and then the id of the larger node.  We check the set for that string, and if it is
there, then we have a duplicate edge and must throw it out and try again.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=gen_graph.cpp>gen_graph.cpp</a></b>.  Note it error checks to make sure
that <i>e</i> is &le; <i>n(n-1)/2</i>.  Think about why:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
using namespace std;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int n;
  int e;
  int i;
  int n1, n2;
  set &lt;string&gt; edges;
  set &lt;string&gt;::iterator eit;
  string s;
  char edge[100];

  if (argc != 3) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "usage: ggraph n e\n";
    exit(1);
  }

  n = atoi(argv[1]);
  
  e = atoi(argv[2]);
  if (e &gt; (n-1) * n / 2) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "e is too big\n";
    exit(1);
  }
  srand48(time(0));

  cout &lt;&lt; "NNODES " &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; endl;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; e; i++) {
    do {
      n1 = lrand48()%n;
      do n2 = lrand48()%n; while (n2 == n1);
      if (n1 &lt; n2) {
        sprintf(edge, "%d %d", n1, n2);
      } else {
        sprintf(edge, "%d %d", n2, n1);
      }
      s = edge;
    } while (edges.find(s) != edges.end());
    
    edges.insert(s);

    cout &lt;&lt; "EDGE " &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
}

It works as it should.  Here we generate two random graphs each 
with ten nodes.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>gen_graph 10 6 > g1.txt</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sleep 1</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>gen_graph 10 9 > g2.txt</b></font>
</pre>

Here are the graph pictures and files:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td valign=top>
<b><a href=g1.txt>g1.txt</a></b>

EDGE 4 6

<b><a href=g2.txt>g2.txt</a></b>

EDGE 5 8
EDGE 3 7

</pre></td></table></center><p>

You'll note, <b>g1</b> has six edges, four connected components and no cycles.
<b>G2</b> has nine edges, two connected components and one cycle (2,7,5,9,2).

<font color=darkred>(As an aside, is the above program really a good one?  Ask youself,
when is it good, and when is it bad?  If you aren't sure of yourself, ask me in class.)</font>
