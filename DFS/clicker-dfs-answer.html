<h3>Answer to DFS Clicker Question</h3>

Here are the adjacency lists for a directed graph:

<UL>
<LI> Node A: { C, D, J }
<LI> Node B: { E, G, H }
<LI> Node C: { I, J }
<LI> Node D: { F, I, J }
<LI> Node E: { G, I }
<LI> Node F: { }
<LI> Node G: { H, I }
<LI> Node H: { I }
<LI> Node I: { }
<LI> Node J: { }
</UL>

Suppose I call <b>DFS(A)</b>.  Suppose the DFS's action is to print the character of the node 
before and after visiting its children.  What are the characters printed in the order in 
which they are printed (just enter a single string with no spaces)?

Let's simply walk through it, and we'll indent each time there is a recursive call:

<pre>
Call                  Printing          Visiting (calling DFS recursively)
--------------------  --------          ---------------------------------
DFS(A)                Print A
DFS(A)                                  Visit C
  DFS(C)              Print C
  DFS(C)                                Visit I
    DFS(I)            Print I  
    DFS(I)                              No children to visit
    DFS(I)            Print I  
  DFS(C)                                Visit J
    DFS(J)            Print J  
    DFS(J)                              No children to visit
    DFS(J)            Print J  
  DFS(C)                                No more children to visit
  DFS(C)              Print C
DFS(A)                                  Visit D
  DFS(D)              Print D
  DFS(D)                                Visit F
    DFS(F)            Print F                    
    DFS(F)                              No children to visit
    DFS(F)            Print F                    
  DFS(D)                                Visit I
    DFS(I)                              Already visited -- return
  DFS(D)                                Visit J
    DFS(J)                              Already visited -- return
  DFS(D)                                No more children to visit
  DFS(D)              Print D
DFS(A)                                  Visit J
  DFS(J)                              Already visited -- return
DFS(A)                                No more children to visit
DFS(A)                Print A
</pre>

So the answer is "ACIIJJCDFFDA".
