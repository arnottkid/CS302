<h3>DFS Clicker Question</h3>

Here are the adjacency lists for a directed graph:

<UL>
<LI> Node A: { C, D, J }
<LI> Node B: { E, G, H }
<LI> Node C: { I, J }
<LI> Node D: { F, I, J }
<LI> Node E: { G, I }
<LI> Node F: { }
<LI> Node G: { H, I }
<LI> Node H: { I }
<LI> Node I: { }
<LI> Node J: { }
</UL>

Suppose I call <b>DFS(A)</b>.  Suppose the DFS's action is to print the character of the node 
before and after visiting its children.  What are the characters printed in the order in 
which they are printed (just enter a single string with no spaces)?
