In the 
<a href=index.html>main set of lecture notes</a>, I show how do to a DFS to 
determine connected components of an undirected graph.  In that implementation,
I use a <b>Graph</b> class, which has a vector of nodes as a member variable.
The DFS is a member function, and for that reason, it can access the <b>Nodes</b>
vector.  This simplifies our implementation somewhat, because the node adjacency 
lists can contain integers -- the indices of the nodes in the <b>Nodes</b> 
vector.
<p>
When I asked in class (this is 2016), whether I should implement the program with
integers in the adjacency lists, or pointers, the class chose pointers.  Nice. 
So, I have implemented this version in
<b><a href=concomp-pointer.cpp>concomp-pointer.cpp</a></b>.  I include the implementation
below with extensive inline comments to help you.  In some respects, this is a simpler
implementation, because it doesn't require a <b>Graph</b> class.  This is because the 
pointers point directly to nodes, and don't require that the nodes be accessible as part
of the <b>Graph</b> class.

<font color=blue>/* The Node class:  

   Each node's adjacency list contains pointers to the nodes that are
   adjacent to them.  This is unlike the code in the main set of
   lecture notes, where the adjacency lists contains integers, and
   the integers are used as indices to a vector that contains all of
   the nodes. */</font>

class Node {
  public:
    int id;
    int component;
    vector &lt;Node *&gt; Adj;
};

<font color=blue>/* Because our adjacency list contains pointers, we don't need a Graph
   class.  We don't need to access the vector of nodes, because
   we access each node directly in the adjacency list with a pointer.
   Contrast this with the other code in the lecture notes, where
   DFS() is a method that is part of a Graph class, which is
   necessary because you need to use the indices to the vector of
   nodes in the graph class.

   Also, in this code, I print out the beginning of each DFS call, indenting
   it with two spaces for every nested level of recursion.  You should take a look
   at that printf call.  I include it here:

   printf("%*sDFS(%d,%d)\n", indent, "", n-&gt;id, cn);

   The asterisk says to read the field width from the next argument -- that means
   that that part of the output will be padded to "indent" spaces.  Following the 
   asterisk is an "s", which means to print out a string (C style).  
   I give it the empty string.  So, if, for example, "indent" is equal to 4, this
   will print out four spaces.

This code is also a little different, because it prints out the beginning of
each <b>DFS()</b> call, with indentation to illustrate the level of nesting.
Read the inline comments to show how I did that using <b>printf()</b>.
