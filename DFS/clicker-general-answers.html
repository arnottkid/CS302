<h3> General Graph Clicker Questions</h3>

An undirected graph is defined as follows:
<p>
<i>V = { i | 0 <= i < 10 }</i><br>
<i>E = { (0,1), (0,3), (1,9), (3,5), (3,7), (4,6), (5,9), (6,8) }</i>
<p>

1. How many connected components are in the graph?
<p>
<i>Answer</i>:
The easiest way to answer this is to draw the graph:

<pre>
0 ------- 1           2
|          \_______
|                  \
3 ------- 5 -------- 9
|
|
7       4---6---8
</pre>

<i>The answer is three.</i>
<p>
2. Which nodes are in the one cycle in this graph?
<p>
<i>Answer</i>:
Look at the graph above: 0, 1, 3, 5, 9.

<p>
3. Is this graph bipartite? 
<p>
No -- it has an odd cycle, and if you think about it, an odd cycle
cannot be in a bitpartite graph.
