This is by no means meant to be a complete treatment of the halting problem.
However, the halting problem is an important problem for you to see, and this
introduction will let you either:
<p>
<OL>
<LI> Have an easier time with it when you get the full treatment later in life.
<LI> Pretend to friends, family and potential employers that you actually understand
     the halting problem.
</OL>
<p>
Let's couch the halting problem as a cruel lab:
<p>
Write the procedure:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
string halt(char *program, char *input);
</pre></td></table></center><p>
Its first parameter, <b>program</b> is the name of a C++ program
which, when compiled, will execute, reading from standard input.
<p>
The program <b>halt</b> must return in a finite amount of time, and what it returns
depends on what happens when <b>program</b> is compiled and executes on the contents
of the file <b>input</b> as standard input.  
If <b>program</b> finishes in a finite amount of time, then <b>halt</b>
should return "halt".  Otherwise, <b>halt</b> should return <b>"infinite loop"</b>
and exit.  
<p>
<b>halt()</b> is not allowed to ever go into an infinite loop.  In other words, it
must eventually finish.
<p>
If you cannot write <b>halt()</b>, prove to me why?

<hr>
<h3>This is the halting problem</h3>

The proof is a bit hinky, but it is sound.  Suppose you can write <b>halt()</b>.
Then you can write the following procedure called <b>selfhalt</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
string selfhalt(char *f)
{
  return halt(f, f);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Next, you can write the program <b>hproblem.cpp</b>, 
which takes just one command line argument, the name of a C++ program:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  if (argc != 1) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "usage: hproblem program\n";
    exit(1);
  }

  if (selfhalt(argv[1]) == "halt") while(1);
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Now, we compile and run <b>hproblem</b> on itself, and we have problems:

<pre>
UNIX> <b>hproblem hproblem.cpp</b>
</pre>

If this program were to exit in a finite period of time, then 
<b>selfhalt("hproblem.cpp")</b> would have returned "infinite loop", which 
means that "<b>hproblem hproblem.cpp</b>" should never return.
<p>
On the other hand, if this program were to loop forever, then
<b>selfhalt("hproblem.cpp")</b> would have returned "halt", which 
means that <b>hproblem hproblem.cpp</b>" should return in a finite
period of time.
<p>
This contradiction is why you cannot write <b>halt()</b> -- if this 
seems like the stuff of puzzle books for precocious 11-year olds,
you're right, but the logic is tight.  If you are interested in
