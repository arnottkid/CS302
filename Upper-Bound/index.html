<h3>Topcoder problems that feature <b>upper_bound()</b> or <b>lower_bound()</b></h3>

<UL>
<LI> <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/topcoder-writeups/2018/HungryCowsEasy/index.html>HungryCowsEasy</a> - This is a nice and simple practice problem for you (D2 250).
<LI> <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/topcoder-writeups/2014/TrianglesContainOrigin/index.html>TrianglesContainOrigin</a> - This one requires a little more work, but it's a nice use of
<b>lower_bound()</b>.
<LI> <a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/topcoder-writeups/2014/MinimumSquare/index.html>MinimumSquare</a> - You don't need <b>lower_bound()</b> to solve the topcoder problem in time, but the
best solution makes you use it.

<h2>The upper_bound() and lower_bound() sets/map methods</h2>

A feature of sets and maps that often gets overlooked is the ability to 
search for an item that may or may not be present, and return the item that
is "near" it.  There are two member
functions of both sets and maps that do this:

<UL>
<LI> <b>upper_bound</b>: returns an iterator to the smallest item greater
than a given key.  If there is no item greater, it returns <b>end()</b>
<p>
<LI> <b>lower_bound</b>: returns an iterator to the smallest item greater
than or equal to a given key.  If there is no item greater or equal, it returns <b>end()</b>
</UL>

<p>
Are the names counter-intuitive?  Yes.  Whatever.  Let's show an example of a program
that uses one.  (BTW, if you want more practice, do the 500-point problem from 
division one of Topcoder SRM 337).
<p>
If you took CS140 from me, you may have done the Keno lab.  I'll refresh your memory
with the preamble to the lab:
<UL>
<i>You are in Vegas with your wife and her family.  On morning number 1, they all
want to go to the "Venetian" hotel and casino to ride the Gondolas.  You have
the choice of going or staying.  Hmmm, let's see.  You've already overpaid once
in your life to ride a real gondola in Venice.  It's something like 500 bazillion
degrees in Vegas, and the gondola rides are in a big concrete
swimming pool.  You thank the family, but send them on their merry way.
<p>
You wander around the casino, and see this game called <i>Keno</i>.  It's a
bit like a lottery.  There are 80 balls numbered 1 through 80, and they will
pick 20 of them randomly.  They have a catchy little flier about all the
Keno bets you can make:
<p>
<table border=3>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=img/K1.jpg width=350></td>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=img/K2.jpg width=200><br>
                <IMG src=img/K3.jpg width=200></td>
<td valign=top> <IMG src=img/K4.jpg width=200></td>
</table>
<p>
Now, we're talking entertainment!  You know there's no way that these
tempting little bets are going to make you money in the long run, but
you have a little mathematical problem to solve, and that's better
than gambling!</i>
</UL>
We're not redoing the Keno lab, fun as it is.  Instead, we have another Keno
problem.  Casino mogul Ronald Thump (BTW, these lecture notes were written well before
Mr. Thump ran for president...) has contacted you to design a tempting side-bet
for his Keno rooms.  Of course, he wants it to make him money, but to seem like it
makes the gambler money.  Here's what you come up with:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=5><td>
<h3>The Lucky Loser Bet</h3>
<UL>
<LI> You choose one number.  
<LI> If that number is one of the 20 picked, then you
simply get your money back.  
<LI> However, if it is not one of the 20 picked, then
you look at the closest number picked that is greater than yours, and the closest
number picked that is less than yours.  (Wrap around if there's no number greater or
less than yours).  
<LI> If the higher number is closer to yours than the lower number, you
win $1.25 on a $1.00 bet.  
<LI> Otherwise, you lose.</ul></td></table></center><p>

Mr. Thump thinks that this is a catchy game.  People may well take out "insurance"
on their Keno bets by choosing all of their Keno picks as Lucky Losers.  At a
very high level, it looks like a good bet for the following reason:
<p>
If your number is picked, nothing matters. However, if it is not picked, then
it would seem as though you have a roughly 50-50 chance of having the closest
number picked be higher than yours.  You're getting $1.25 instead of $1.00 on
what seems to be a 50-50 chance.  I'd take those odds!
<p>
Now, of course, the odds aren't 50-50.  Why?  Suppose the numbers 4 and 8 are picked, 
but 5, 6 and 7 are not.  7 is winning bet, but 6 and 5 are not.  In other words,
when the interval between picked balls is an odd number <i>i</i>, then there are
<i>(i-1)/2</i> winners and <i>(i+1)/2</i> losers.  
Of course, if the interval is an even number, then there are an equal number of 
winners and losers.  
<p>
It would take some good math to figure out the closed-form probability of the Lucky Loser
bet.  However, we can simulate, and that's just as good, at least to Mr. Thump.
We'll go through a sequence of programs that illustrate a number of points.
<hr>
<h3>Program #1 - using lower_bound</h3>

I'm not going through all of this program.  The basic version is in 
<b><a href=src/keno-ll.cpp>src/keno-ll.cpp</a></b>.  Let's first look at 
our class definition for a <b>Keno_LL</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Keno_LL {
  public:
    int NB;                       <font color=blue>// Initial parameter: Number of balls in play (80 in our example)</font>
    int NP;                       <font color=blue>// Initial parameter: Number of balls picked each time (20 in our example)</font>
    double Payout;                <font color=blue>// This is how much you win in the Lucky Loser bet (1.25 in our example)</font>
    int Iterations;               <font color=blue>// Number of iterations for the simulation. 0 if interactive</font>
    int Verbose;                  <font color=blue>// Output on each iteration, or just at the end?</font>

    set &lt;int&gt; Picked;             <font color=blue>// This is used for the balls picked at each iteration</font>

    int Wins, Losses, Ties;       <font color=blue>// Stats - total wins, losses and ties</font>
    double Winnings;              <font color=blue>// Total winnings (yes, we could calculate from above)</font>
    double N;                     <font color=blue>// Iteration so far</font>

    void Do_Picking();            <font color=blue>// Creates Picked randomly</font>
    void Calculate_Payout(int b); <font color=blue>// Given a ball b, and set Picked, calculates the payout and updates the stats.</font>
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

All these are straightforward.  At each iteration, we'll call <b>Do_Picking()</b>, which will put <b>NP</b>
random numbers from 1 to <b>NB</b> into <b>Picked</b>.  Then we'll get a value of <b>b</b>, either from 
standard input or randomly, and call <b>Calculate_Payout()</b>, which will determine whether <b>b</b> is a 
winner, loser or tie, and update all those stats accordingly.  
I won't show the code for the <b>main()</b> -- it simply parses command line arguments, sets up an instance
of the <b>Keno_LL</b> class, and makes the appropriate calls to <b>Do_Picking()</b> and <b>Calculate_Payout()</b>.
<p>
Let's take a look at those methods:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Procedure to pick the keno balls randomly.  The balls are put into the
   set "Picked," which is sentinelized so that the first ball is  
   at the end of the set, after the maximum numbered ball, and the  
   last ball is at the beginning of the set, before ball 1. */</font>

void Keno_LL::Do_Picking()
{
  int i, j, first, last;
  set &lt;int&gt;::iterator pbit;

  Picked.clear();
  
  for (i = 0; i &lt; NP; i++) {
    do j = random()%NB+1; while (Picked.find(j) != Picked.end());
    Picked.insert(j);
  }

  if (Verbose) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Balls Picked:";
    for (pbit = Picked.begin(); pbit != Picked.end(); pbit++) {
      cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; *pbit;
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; ".\n";
  }

  first = *(Picked.begin());       <font color=blue>/* Sentinelize Picked */</font>
  last = *(Picked.rbegin());
  Picked.insert(NB+first);
  Picked.insert(last-NB);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<b>Do_Picking()</b> puts random numbers into a set.   It takes care not to put duplicates into the
set.  If specified, it prints out the balls picked.  At the end, it sentinelizes the set.  If the 
smallest element is <i>s</i> and the largest <i>l</i>, then it inserts <i>(l-NB)</i> and
<i>(NB+s)</i> into the set.  This is to handle the case when the ball that the contestant picks
is lower than all the picked balls, or higher than all the picked balls.  Then, you don't have to
have any special case code in <b>Calculate_Payout()</b>.  (<i>I'll go over this in greater detail
below.</i>)
<p>
Here's <b>Calculate_Payout():</b>

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void Keno_LL::Calculate_Payout(int b)
{
  set &lt;int&gt;::iterator pbit;
  int u, l;
  double win;
  
  <font color=blue>/* Determine whether b is picked (a tie), a winner or a loser. */</font>

  pbit = Picked.lower_bound(b);
  if (*pbit == b) {
    win = 0;
    Ties++;
  } else {
    u = *pbit;
    pbit--;
    l = *pbit;
    if (u - b &lt; b - l) {
      win = Payout;
      Wins++;
    } else {
      win = -1;
      Losses++;
    }
  }
 
  <font color=blue>/* Update stats, and print out what happened, if desired. */</font>

  Winnings += win;
  N++;

  if (Verbose) {
    if (win == 0) {
      printf("  Your ball was picked. +0: ");
    } else {
      printf("  D to higher: %d.  D to lower: %d.  %+.2lf: ",
        u-b, b-l, win);
    }
    printf("Total = %.2lf.  Avg = %.6lf\n", Winnings, Winnings/N);
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I use the <b>lower_bound</b> method to find the smallest element in <b>Picked</b> that is
greater than or equal to <b>b</b>.  Since we sentinelized <b>Picked</b>, we're guaranteed
that there will be an element greater than <b>b</b> and an element less than <b>b</b>.
That's nice, because we don't have to test whether <b>pit</b> is equal to 
<b>Picked.end()</b> or <b>Picked.begin()</b>.
<p>
If we didn't find the element, then we find the balls greater than and less than <b>b</b>
with "<tt>u = *pbit; pbit--; l = *pbit;</tt>".  This is because you're allowed to increment
and decrement iterators to move around the set.  
<p>
The rest of the code is straightforward.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>A little more detail on the sentinels in <i>Picked</i></h3>

I received a lot of questions in class about the sentinels.  Let me give a concrete example.
Suppose the balls picked are as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
2 3 5 12 13 26 31 35 36 38 44 45 51 54 60 65 67 68 70 76
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And suppose that we <i>don't</i> use a sentinel in <b>Picked</b>.
Let me give three different examples of numbers that the user chooses.  Suppose that
the user chooses 37.  We'll look that up in <b>Picked</b> using <b>Picked.lower_bound()</b>.
It will return an iterator to 38, because 38 is the smallest value greater than or equal
to 37.  We can decrement the iterator to find the greatest value less than 37 -- that is
36.  Thus, we can determine that the user's pick was a loser quite easily.
<p>
In example 2, suppose that the user chooses 1.  When we call <b>Picked.lower_bound()</b>,
it will return an iterator to 2.  Since 2 is the smallest value in the set, we'll need
to write special-purpose code to calculate that 76 is the "greatest value less than" 1, and
that its distance from 1 is 5.  That's a drag.
<p>
In example 3, suppose that the user chooses 77.  Now, <b>Picked.lower_bound()</b> is going to 
return <b>Picked.end()</b>, and we have to write more special-purpose code to determine that
76 is the lower value and 2 is the "higher" value.  
<p>
We use the sentinels to avoid writing all of that special-purpose code.  We insert 82 = 2+80 and
-4 = 76-80 into the set, which now becomes:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
-4 2 3 5 12 13 26 31 35 36 38 44 45 51 54 60 65 67 68 70 76 82
</pre></td></table></center><p>
We are now guaranteed of two things when we call 
<b>Picked.lower_bound()</b>:
<OL>
<LI> It will never return <b>Picked.end()</b>.  In other words it will always return an iterator
to an element that equals the user's choice, or that is the smallest element greater than the
user's choice.
<LI> It will never return the first element of <b>Picked</b>.  Which means that when you 
decrement it to find the greatest element smaller than the user's choice, it will point
to a valid value.
</OL>

And we don't have to write any special purpose code.  Judicious use of sentinels
can make your code very clean.  Remember our implementation of 
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs140/Notes/Linked/index.html>doubly-linked lists
in CS140? </a>  Without that header node, the implementation would be really messy.  The
sentinel (the header node) made for clean and efficient code.

Let's run it.  The parameters of the program are <b>NB</b>, <b>NP</b>,

Well, it appears to be converging slightly, but man, that's slow.  First, let's

buck.

<h3>Better randomization</h3>

There are definitely a few places to work on speeding up.  First is <b>Do_Picking()</b>.
That's a poor way to choose random numbers, since you may have to throw numbers away 
when you choose duplicates.  Think about it -- what if <b>NP</b> is really close to
<b>NB</b>?  Then when you get to the last balls, you're more likely to have to throw
away a pick than not.  
<p>
A better way is to put all of the numbers from 1 to 80 into an array, and then randomly
pull them out.  Each time you "pull a number out", you move it to the end of the array,
and then don't consider it for the next pick.  
<p>
The new code is in 
<b><a href=src/keno-ll2.cpp>src/keno-ll2.cpp</a></b>.  I've added a vector <b>Balls</b>
to the <b>Keno_LL</b> class, and I have initialized it to hold the numbers 1 thorugh <b>NB</b>.
Then, <b>Do_Picking()</b> works as follows:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void Keno_LL::Do_Picking()
{
  int i, j, first, last, tmp;
  set &lt;int&gt;::iterator pbit;

  Picked.clear();
  
  for (i = 0; i &lt; NP; i++) {
    j = random()%(NB-i);
    tmp = Balls[j];
    Balls[j] = Balls[NB-i-1];
    Balls[NB-i-1] = tmp;
    Picked.insert(Balls[NB-i-1]);
  }

  ...
</pre></td></table></center><p>

It runs faster, but not by a huge amount (9 percent):

<h3>Better sampling</h3>

Can we do better?  Well, consider this -- instead of trying one random ball on each 
iteration, let's just look at all of them.  We'll do this in a method called
<b>Calculate_All()</b>, which we only call when we're doing multiple iterations.
Here is a very simple implementation, which simply calls <b>Calculate_Pick()</b>
for all balls 
(in <b><a href=src/keno-ll3.cpp>src/keno-ll3.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void Keno_LL::Calculate_All()
{
  int b;

  for (b = 1; b &lt;= NB; b++) Calculate_Payout(b);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We'll compile with optimization and run it:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make bin/keno-ll3</b></font>
g++ -O3 -o bin/keno-ll3 src/keno-ll3.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time bin/keno-ll3 80 20 1.25 1000000 n</b></font>
Total = -27149.25.  Avg = -0.027149.  W/L/T: 321267 428733 250000
0.108u 0.001s 0:00.10 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Dang, that was fast!  It's because we're iterating 1000000/80 times instead
of 1000000.  Granted, we're doing a little more work at each iteration, but
not much.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Faster sampling</h3>

We can make it faster still, though.  We don't really need to calculate
the picks for every ball.  Instead, we can just run through the set and
check each interval.  If the interval size is <i>x</i>, then there will 
be <i>x/2</i> winners (integer division) and <i>x - x/2</i> losers.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=src/keno-ll4.cpp>src/keno-ll4.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void Keno_LL::Calculate_All()
{
  set &lt;int&gt;::iterator low, high;
  int x, highest;
  int nw, nl;

  highest = *Picked.rbegin();
  low = Picked.begin();
  high = low;
  high++;
  nw = 0;
  nl = 0;

  while (*high != highest) {
    x = *high - *low - 1;
    nw += (x/2);
    nl += (x - x/2);
    low++;
    high++;
  }
  Wins += nw;
  Losses += nl;
  Ties += NP;
  Winnings += nw*Payout;
  Winnings -= nl;
  N += NB;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Note once again how the sentinels help us keep our code clean.  
It speeds matters up even further:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>make bin/keno-ll4</b></font>
g++ -O3 -o bin/keno-ll4 src/keno-ll4.cpp
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time bin/keno-ll4 80 20 1.25 1000000 n</b></font>
Total = -27682.50.  Avg = -0.027682.  W/L/T: 321030 428970 250000
0.076u 0.000s 0:00.07 100.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w

</pre>

0.076 vs 0.102 may not seem like much, but it is over 25 percent.

<h3>Using a more efficient data structure</h3>

I typically end here in class, but simply talk about this section.
We can make this faster.  How?
Get rid of the set.  Instead, simply put the picked balls into an array and
sort the array with the STL procedure <b>sort()</b>.  Then you traverse the
array in <b>Calculate_All()</b> instead of the set.  
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=src/keno-ll5.cpp>src/keno-ll5.cpp</a></b>, where we write a separate
<b>Do_Picking_Array()</b> which puts the balls into an array <b>PBalls</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void Keno_LL::Do_Picking_Array()
{
  int i, j, first, last, tmp;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; NP; i++) {
    j = random()%(NB-i);
    tmp = Balls[j];
    Balls[j] = Balls[NB-i-1];
    Balls[NB-i-1] = tmp;
    PBalls[i] = Balls[NB-i-1];
  }
  PBalls[i] = NB+1;   <font color=blue>/* Make room for the sentinel at the end */</font>
  sort(PBalls.begin(), PBalls.end());
  PBalls[NP] = NB+PBalls[0];  <font color=blue>/* Put a sentinel at the end */</font>

  if (Verbose) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Balls Picked:";
    for (i = 0; i &lt; NP; i++) cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; PBalls[i];
    cout &lt;&lt; ".\n";
  }

}

void Keno_LL::Calculate_All()
{
  int i, x;
  int nw, nl;

  nw = 0;
  nl = 0;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; NP; i++) {
    x = PBalls[i+1] - PBalls[i] - 1;
    nw += (x/2);
    nl += (x - x/2);
  }
  Wins += nw;
  Losses += nl;
  Ties += NP;
  Winnings += nw*Payout;
  Winnings -= nl;
  N += NB;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Note how the array is again sentinelized.  The array <b>PBalls</b> has <b>NP+1</b> elements.
After putting the random balls in unsorted order into <b>PBalls</b>, we set 
<b>PBalls[NP]</b> to equal <b>NB+1</b>, and then we sort it.  That way, we know
that <b>PBalls[NP]</b> will remain equal to <b>NB+1</b>.  After the sort, we know that
the minimum element is in <b>PBalls[0]</b>, so we can put <b>PBalls[0]+NB</b> into the last
<b>PBalls[NP]</b>.  Now we have all the intervals represented easily in <b>PBalls</b>.
<p>
When we run it, it's much, much faster -- this is the best code for the problem:

We can confidently tell Mr. Thump that this bet will make him 2.78 cents
on every dollar bet.  My guess is that he'd like a little more.  If you
make the payout $1.20 instead of $1.25, his profit goes to
4.38 cents.  How does that compare?  Well, Roulette is a profit of 5 
cents.  Three card poker goes anywhere from 1.96 cents to about 10,
depending on the odds.  I'd say you've invented a pretty good game!

<h3>What have we learned?</h3>

Well, my goals here were twofold.  First, I wanted to teach you <b>upper_bound</b>
and <b>lower_bound</b>.  Second, I wanted to show you how the choice of algorithm
and data structure impacts performance.  While the code in <b>src/keno-ll.cpp</b> was
reasonable to solve the problem, it had three performance deficiencies:
<p>
<OL>
<LI> The random ball-picking algorithm was inefficient.
<LI> The code for multiple iterations had too much randomness -- calculating the
probabilities for all 80 balls at each iteration is a much smarter and
faster way to perform
the evalution.
<LI> Performing insertions/finds with a set is slower than using an vector and sorting.
The code for <b>Do_Picking()</b> and <b>Calculate_All()</b> is <i>O(<b>NP</b> log(<b>NP</b>))</i>
in both cases.  However, the vector version is faster, largely because it is more memory-
efficient.
</OL>
<p>
As a final thought exercise, would you have to change your implementation 
if <b>NB</b> is huge (say, 500,000,000) and <b>NP</b> is much smaller (say, 1000)?
Think about it, and if you want your thought process corroborated, ask me in 
class.
