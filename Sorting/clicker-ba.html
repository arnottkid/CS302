<h3>Answer to Bucket Sort Question</h3>
You are given the string "CHDIBGJCDIHHH" which you want to sort with bucket sort.  You'll
start by bucket sorting it into an array of 26 elements.  After that, you'll copy the
non-empty array elements back into a string of 13 elements, which you will then sort with
insertion sort.  What is the string before you do insertion sort?  (If you have a choice of
indices, choose the lower one):

Let's insert the characters, one at a time into the table:
<p>
<center>
<table border=3 cellpadding=10><td valign=top><pre>
C
H
D
I
B
G
J
C
D
I
H
H
H
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
     A  C   8th character -- the open slots were equidistant
     B  B   5th character
     C  C   1st character      
     D  D   3rd character
     E  D   9th character
     F  H   11th character     
     G  G   6th character
     H  H   2nd character      
     I  I   4th character
     J  J   7th character
     K  I   10th character      
     L  H   12th character
     M  H   13th character
     N  -      
     O  -      
     P  -      
     Q  -      
     R  -      
     S  -      
     T  -      
     U  -      
     V  -      
     W  -      
     X  -      
     Y  -      
     Z  -      
</pre></td><table>

So the answer is "CBCDDHGHIJIHH".
