<h3>Answers To Quicksort Clicker Questions</h3>

You are sorting the following vector with quicksort.

<pre>
38.60
52.97
73.54
20.54
62.94
15.22
32.80
49.89
68.65
94.99
39.10
</pre>

<b>Question 1</b>:
What are the first two numbers that are swapped in the partitioning (answer with the
two numbers separated by a single space)?
<p>
<i>Answer: The pivot is 38.60, regarless of whether you are using the "median-of-three"
pivot selection algorithm or not.
The first number in the "left" set is 52.97, which is greater than the pivot, so it will
be swapped into the "right" set.  We will look at elements in the "right" set from back to
front.  We skip over those that are greater than the pivot: 39.10, 94.99, 68.65, and 49.89.
We stop at 32.80, and swap it with 52.97.  That is the answer.</i>

<b>Question 2</b>:
What will be the index of 38.60 after the partitioning?
<p>
<i>Answer: Continuing, we'll swap 15.22 and 73.54.  After that, the "left" and "right"
pointers will cross -- the "left" one stopping at 62.94, and the right one stopping
at  20.54.  We'll swap the pivot with the last element of the "left" set, so it is swapped
with 20.54.  The answer is 3.</i>

<b>Question 3</b>: If we are using the median-of-three pivot selection algorithm, what will
the pivot be if we're sorting the vector below:

<pre>
69.10
36.00
63.88
96.50
46.32
83.16
09.39
10.59
61.34
42.57
96.47
</pre>
<p>
<i>Answer: The median of 69.10, 83.16 and 96.47 is 83.16.</i>

<b>Question 4</b>: If we are using the median-of-three pivot selection algorithm, what will
the pivot be if we're sorting the vector below:

<pre>
51.80
38.59
06.85
01.70
62.44
16.53
26.70
24.43
85.15
52.94
23.13
