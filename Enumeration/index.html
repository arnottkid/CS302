<h2>Introduction</h2>

There are times in your CS careers where you will be called upon to perform
an enumeration, and if you're not ready for it, it may be a bit confusing.
There are a few primary types of enumeration, which are the focus of this set of
lecture notes.  As always, I focus on how you can implement these yourself,
even though there is linguistic support for some of them (e.g. Permutations in C++).
<hr>
<h3>Numbers / Strings: Div and Mod</h3>

The first type of enumeration is a problem where you have an 
array of size <i>l</i>, and each element of the array can have one
of <i>n</i> values (repetitions are fine).  Here are three examples:

<UL>
<LI> Enumerate all 5-character strings containing the letters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.  Here,
     <i>n</i> is three and <i>l</i> is five.
<LI> Enumerate all 4-digit numbers in base 6.  Here, <i>n</i> is six and <i>l</i> is four.
<LI> Suppose you have an infinite number of balls, which can have five colors.  If two
     balls have the same color, they are indistinguishable.  And suppose you have 7 
     numbered boxes.  Enumerate the distinguishable ways that you put balls into the boxes.
     Here, <i>n</i> is five and <i>l</i> is seven.
</UL>

To solve the problem with enumeration,
you need to generate all possible values of the array.  There will be <i>n<sup>l</sup></i>
ways to do this, so <i>n</i> and <i>l</i> will have to be be relatively small.
To enumerate, generate the numbers between 0 and 
<i>n<sup>l</sup>-1</i>.  For each of these numbers, populate each successive element of the
array by taking the number modulo <i>n</i>.  Then divide the number by <i>n</i> (using integer
division).    
<p>
Lets' do a small example.  Suppose you want to enumerate all 2-digit numbers that contain the
digits 0, 1 and 2.  In this example, <i>n</i> is 3, and <i>l</i> is 2, so you need to enumerate
the numbers between 0 and 8 (which is 3<sup>2</sup>-1), 
and convert each of those into the proper two digit number using
div and mod.  Here's a table:
<p>
<pre>
  i     i%n    i/n    (i/n)%n     Result
  0      0      0         0         00
  1      1      0         0         10
  2      2      0         0         20
  3      0      1         1         01
  4      1      1         1         11
  5      2      1         1         21
  6      0      2         2         02
  7      1      2         2         12
  8      2      2         2         22
</pre>

The program <b><a href=src/divmod.cpp>src/divmod.cpp</a></b>
takes two command line arguments <i>l</i> and <i>n</i>, and enumerates all strings
of length <i>l</i> that are composed of the first <i>n</i> letters of the alphabet.
Here, I show the relevant code.  All variables are <b>ints</b>.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  <font color=blue>/* Calculate n^l.  This is inefficient, but since l is small, it's ok. */</font>

  top = 1;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; l; i++) top *= n;

  <font color=blue>/* Enumerate the numbers from 0 to n^l-1, and for each of these
     numbers extract each digit when the number is considered in 
     base n.  We do that by taking the number mod n, and then 
     dividing the number by n. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; top; i++) {
    j = i;
    for (k = 0; k &lt; l; k++) {
      digit = j % n;
      j /= n; 
      printf("%c", 'a'+digit);
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Let's do the example above:

<pre>

bb
cb
ac
bc
cc
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

In class, I did an example where <i>n</i> equals 5 and <i>l</i> equals four, and 
I used Unix tools to prove that the answer had to be correct:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/divmod 4 5 | head </b></font>                            <font color=blue>// We're just taking a look here.</font>

     625     625    3125

     625     625    3125
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/divmod 4 5 | sed 's/[a-e]/x/g' | sort -u </b></font>  <font color=blue>// This ensures that the only characters printed are a-e and x.</font>
xxxx
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/divmod 4 5 | sed 's/[a-e]/y/g' | sort -u</b></font>   <font color=blue>// This ensures that there were in fact no x's.</font>

</pre>

<hr>
To reiterate mathematically: If you are generating all <i>l</i>-length vectors <i>v</i>
that contain numbers between zero and <i>n</i>, you enumerate
<i>j</i> from zero to <i>n<sup>l</sup>-1</i>, and then:
<p>
<center>
<i>v[i] = (j/(n<sup>i</sup>))%n</i>.
</center><p>
<hr>

<h3>Power Set Enumeration (Enumeration of Subsets): Using bits</h3>

Sometimes you need to enumerate all subsets of a set of <i>l</i>
items.  This is called the <i>Power Set</i> of a set.  There are
<i>2<sup>l</sup></i> such subsets, and the easiest way to visualize
a subset is as a <i>l</i>-element bit string.  Each element in 
the set corresponds to a digit in <i>l</i>, and if a digit's value
is one, then the element belongs to the subset.
<p>
You'll note, this is the same problem as above -- you want to generate all
<i>l</i>-length vectors <i>v</i> that contain numbers between zero and two.
While we can use the same method as above with div and mod, when you are dealing
with zeros and ones exclusively, you can use bit arithmetic to do the same
task more quickly.
<p>
We'll motivate with an example.  Suppose I have four people, Larry, Curly, Moe and Shemp,
and I want to enumerate all possible ways that I can make a team
from them, where a team is a collection of one or more people.
Each potential team may be represented by a bit string as defined
above, and as long as the bit string has a one in it, it represents
a valid team.  Here are all teams and their representative strings:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
1000 Larry
0100 Curly
1100 Larry Curly
0010 Moe
1010 Larry Moe
0110 Curly Moe
1110 Larry Curly Moe
0001 Shemp
1001 Larry Shemp
0101 Curly Shemp
1101 Larry Curly Shemp
0011 Moe Shemp
1011 Larry Moe Shemp
0111 Curly Moe Shemp
1111 Larry Curly Moe Shemp
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Enumerating these bit strings can be done as in the previous
section: <i>l</i> equals <i>4</i> and <i>n</i> equals 2.  Again,
instead of using div and mod, we can use bit arithmetic.
First, <i>2<sup>l</sup></i> may be calculated
with bit arithmetic as (1 &lt;&lt; <i>l</i>).  Next, if you want
to see if the <i>j</i>-th digit of the bit string <i>s</i> is one, test
whether (<i>s</i> &amp; (1 &lt;&lt; <i>j</i>)) is non-zero.
This gives us all we need to know to enumerate sets.  
<p>
For example, the program 
<b><a href=src/gen-teams.cpp>src/gen-teams.cpp</a></b> reads in names from 
standard input, and then generates all possible teams from those names.
It is what I used to generate the teams above.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int main()
{
  vector &lt;string&gt; people;
  string s;
  int i, j;

  while (cin &gt;&gt; s) people.push_back(s);
  if (s.size() &gt; 30) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "Sorry, not generating more than 2^30 teams\n";
    exit(1);
  }

  for (i = 1; i &lt; (1 &lt;&lt; people.size()); i++) {
    for (j = 0; j &lt; people.size(); j++) {   <font color=blue>// Print the bit strings</font>
      printf("%c", (i & (1 &lt;&lt; j)) ? '1' : '0');
    }
    for (j = 0; j &lt; people.size(); j++) {   <font color=blue>// Print the teams</font>
      if (i & (1 &lt;&lt; j)) printf(" %s", people[j].c_str());
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

There's not much subtle here -- once you know how to generate <i>2<sup>l</sup></i>
and to test whether digit <i>j</i> is equal to one using bit arithmetic, the
rest falls out naturally.
<p>
I'm reiterating here, but once again, what we are doing is representing sets
using integers and bits rather than the STL.
When I want to represent a set of distinct numbers between 0 and 31.
I can do it using a 32-element bit string, where bit <i>j</i> is one if
<i>j</i> is an element of the set.  Since <b>ints</b> are 32-bits, I can represent
each set with one integer.  That's nice.  I can represent a set of distinct
numbers between 0 and 63 with a <b>long long</b>.  That can also be nice.
<p>
An good example Topcoder problem that you can solve with a power set enumeration is SRM 604, D2, 500-pointer (PowerOfThreeEasy).
I have lecture notes for that 
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/topcoder-writeups/2014/PowerOfThreeEasy/index.html>here</a>, and I go over the program
in class.
<p>
A second good Topcoder problem that uses this kind of enumeration is SRM 489, D2, 500-point problem. 
(Problem description: <a href=http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=11191&rd=14242>http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=11191&rd=14242</a>).  This one is a little harder.  I have lecture notes about solving that problem

<h3>Using Recursion to perform an "<i>n</i> choose <i>k</i>" Enumeration</h3>

Sometimes enumerations are more subtle than the above.  For example,
suppose I want to generate all three-person teams from a collection 
of <i>n</i> people.  This is an "<i>n</i> choose <i>k</i>" enumeration, 
where <i>k</i> is equal to 3.  It's not as easy to simply generate all numbers from 
0 to <i>(n!)/((3!)((n-3)!))</i> and match each number to a team.  Or at
least I don't see an easy way to do it.  
<p>
Instead, you can often write a recursive function to help you enumerate.
An example is in 
<b><a href=src/gen-3-teams.cpp>src/gen-3-teams.cpp</a></b>.
This program generates all three-person teams from a collection of people
entered on standard input.  The program maintains two variables: <b>people</b>,
which is the vector of people, and <b>team</b>, which is a team that gets incrementally
constructed.
The heart of the program is <b>GenTeams(int index, int npeople)</b>, which is a recursive 
method that builds all possible <b>team</b>s.  Its two parameters are as follows:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b>index</b> is an index into <b>people</b>.  <b>GenTeams()</b> is initially called
with <b>index = 0</b>, and every time it is called recursively, <b>index</b> is incremented.
<LI> <b>npeople</b> is the number of people left to put on <b>teams</b>.  You could omit it
and simply use <b>(3 - teams.size())</b>, but I think it's clearer to have <b>npeople</b> 
be a parameter.
</UL>
<p>
<b>GenTeams()</b> first checks base cases -- if <b>npeople</b> is zero, then there are no
people left to put on <b>teams</b> -- you can print <b>teams</b> and return.  Next, check 
to see if there are enough people left in <b>people</b> to make the team.  If not, return.
Otherwise, you do two recursive calls.  The first puts <b>people[index]</b> on the team
and calls <b>GenTeams(index+1, npeople-1)</b>.  The second skips <b>people[index]</b> 
and simply calls <b>GenTeams(index+1, npeople)</b>.  In other words, you are enumerating
all teams with <b>people[index]</b> on them, and all teams without <b>people[index]</b>.
<p>
Here is the code:
<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class People {
  public:
    vector &lt;string&gt; people;
    vector &lt;string&gt; team;
    void GenTeams(int index, int npeople);
};

void People::GenTeams(int index, int npeople)
{
  int i;

  <font color=blue>/* Base case -- if there are no more people to add, 
     print out the team and return */</font>

  if (npeople == 0) {
    cout &lt;&lt; team[0];
    for (i = 1; i &lt; team.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; team[i];
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    return;
  }

  <font color=blue>/* This is a second base case -- if there are fewer people left to add
     than there are places left on the team, then it's impossible to finish,
     so simply return.  Ask yourself why this is better than testing whether
     index is equal to people.size(), and returning if so. */</font>

  if (npeople &gt; people.size() - index) return;

  <font color=blue>/* Now, put the person in people[index] onto the team, and call GenTeams()
     recursively.  Afterwards, take the person off of the team. */</font>
  
  team.push_back(people[index]);
  GenTeams(index+1, npeople-1);
  team.pop_back();

  <font color=blue>/* Finally, call GenTeams() recursively without putting
     people[index] on the team. */</font>

  GenTeams(index+1, npeople);
}

int main()
{
  People P;
  string s;
  int i, j;

  while (cin &gt;&gt; s) P.people.push_back(s);
  
  P.GenTeams(0, 3);
}

<h3>Using Recursion to Permute</h3>

<b><i>I am purposefully not using the STL Algorithm library here to permute.
It has a functionality that allows you to generate the "next lexicographically
ordered permutation" of a vector.  You should learn that on your own time, but I 
want to you understand
<font color=red>how</font> these things are done, not merely how you can get
them done expediently.</b></i>
<p>
A very similar recursion may be used to generate all permutations
of a collection of elements.  In the example, I again read in names, and
this time print out all permutations.  The structure of the enumeration is
again a recursion, which works as follows
(in <b><a href=src/gen-permutations.cpp>src/gen-permutations.cpp</a></b>):

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class People {
  public:
    vector &lt;string&gt; people;
    void GenPermutations(int index);
};

void People::GenPermutations(int index)
{
  int i;
  string tmp;

  <font color=blue>/* Base case -- we're done - print out the vector */</font>

  if (index == people.size()) {
    cout &lt;&lt; people[0];
    for (i = 1; i &lt; people.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; people[i];
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    return;
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Otherwise, for each element of the vector, swap it with the element
     in index, call GenPermutations() recursively on the remainder of the
     vector, and then swap it back. */</font>
     
  for (i = index; i &lt; people.size(); i++) {

    tmp = people[i];         <font color=blue>/* Swap people[index] with people[i] */</font>
    people[i] = people[index];
    people[index] = tmp;

    GenPermutations(index+1);  

    tmp = people[i];          <font color=blue>/* Swap back */</font>
    people[i] = people[index];
    people[index] = tmp;
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

How many lines are there if you are permuting <i>n</i> items?  Well, there are <i>n</i> ways to choose the first item, then <i>n-1</i> to choose the second, etc.  So, there are <i>(n!)</i> ways to permute <i>n</i> items, which will lead to <i>n!</i> lines of output:

<h3>Balls in Boxes</h3>

The last two programs above are what I call "balls in boxes" problems.  The general
form of these problems is that you have <i>n</i> different colored balls.  There are <i>c</i>
distinct colors, labeled
<i>c<sub>0</sub>, c<sub>1</sub> ...  c<sub>c-1</sub></i>.  For
each color, <i>c<sub>i</sub></i>, there are <i>b<sub>i</sub></i> identical balls 
of that color.  The sum of all 
<i>b<sub>i</sub></i> is therefore <i>n</i>, and you have <i>n</i> boxes numbered 0 to <i>n-1</i>.
The problem is to enumerate all
distinct ways that you can put the balls into the boxes.
<p>
For example, in the
<b>gen-3-teams</b> problem, you have <i>n</i> people and you want to enumerate the 
number of three-person teams.  That is equivalent to having <i>n</i> boxes, and balls
with two colors.  Call them black and white.  There are three black balls and <i>n-3</i>
white balls. You want to enumerate all distinct ways to put the balls into the boxes.
A configuration of balls and boxes is equivalant to a team -- associate each person with 
a box, and if the box has a black ball, then the person is on the team.
<p>
In the permutation example, <i>b<sub>i</sub></i> equals one for all <i>i</i>.  Thus enumerating balls
and boxes gives you permutations.
<p>
In my last example, I'll write a general balls-in-boxes program.  As with the others,
it is recursive.  To start with the explanation, here is the scaffolding -- a class named
<b>BallsInBoxes</b> that has the definition of the balls, a vector to hold the boxes, and
a method called <b>GenInstances()</b> that will do the enumeration.  Its main simply reads in the
ball colors from standard input and prints them out.  The program is in 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-0.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-0.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
using namespace std;

<font color=blue>/* Our class definition for the "Balls in Boxes" problem. */</font>

class BallsInBoxes {
  public:
    map &lt;string,int&gt; balls;           <font color=blue>// Key = color of the ball.  Val =<font color=blue> # of balls with that color</font></font>
    vector &lt;string&gt; boxes;            <font color=blue>// We will put the colors into each of the boxes.</font>
    void GenInstances(size_t index);  <font color=blue>// Recursive method to solve the problem.</font>
};

<font color=blue>/* Recursive method to solve the problem.  We'll write this later. */</font>

void BallsInBoxes::GenInstances(size_t index)
{
  (void) index;
}

int main()
{
  BallsInBoxes B;                    <font color=blue>/* The instance of the BallsInBoxes class. */</font>
  string s;                          <font color=blue>/* This is for reading in the color of each ball. */</font>
  int nb;                            <font color=blue>/* This stores the number of balls/boxes while reading */</font>
  map &lt;string, int&gt;::iterator mit;

  nb = 0;               <font color=blue>/* Read the balls as strings on standard input. */</font>
  while (cin &gt;&gt; s) { 
    B.balls[s]++; 
    nb++; 
  }
  B.boxes.resize(nb);

  <font color=blue>/* Print general info. */</font>

  printf("Total balls & boxes: %d\n", nb);
  for (mit = B.balls.begin(); mit != B.balls.end(); mit++) {
    printf("Color: %-10s   <font color=blue> # Balls: %d\n", mit-&gt;first.c_str(), mit-&gt;second);</font>
  }
  
  B.GenInstances(0);  <font color=blue>// This does nothing for now.</font>
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Let's verify that it works as anticipated:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo red red blue yellow red blue | bin/balls-in-boxes-0</b></font>
Total balls & boxes: 6
Color: blue          # Balls: 2
Color: red           # Balls: 3
Color: yellow        # Balls: 1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo a b c d a b a a a a a | bin/balls-in-boxes-0</b></font>
Total balls & boxes: 11
Color: a             # Balls: 7
Color: b             # Balls: 2
Color: c             # Balls: 1
Color: d             # Balls: 1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Now, we write <b>GenInstances()</b>.
At each call, there is a vector (which represents the boxes)
that has been partially filled in with <b>index</b> boxes, and a map that contains the balls 
that have not been placed yet.  For each color in the map, we place a ball into the next element of
the vector, remove the ball from the map, and call the procedure recursively.  After
the recursive call, we replace the ball in the map.
<p>
Here it is, in 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-1.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-1.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void BallsInBoxes::GenInstances(int index)
{
  int i;
  map &lt;string, int&gt;::iterator bit;

  <font color=blue>/* Base case -- if you have placed all of the balls in boxes,
     print them out, and return. */</font>

  if (index == boxes.size()) {
    cout &lt;&lt; boxes[0];
    for (i = 1; i &lt; boxes.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; boxes[i];
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    return;
  }

  <font color=blue>/* For each color where you haven't placed a ball yet, place the ball, 
     make a recursive call, and remove the ball. */</font>

  for (bit = balls.begin(); bit != balls.end(); bit++) {
    if (bit-&gt;second &gt; 0) {
      boxes[index] = bit-&gt;first;
      bit-&gt;second--;
      GenInstances(index+1);  
      bit-&gt;second++;
      <font color=blue>/* I don't actually "remove" the ball here, because subsequent iterations
         of the loop, or subsequent recursive calls will overwrite boxes[index]. */</font>
    }
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Verify to yourself that it is giving you correct output in all of the examples below:

<h3>A very subtle bug with iterators</h3>

Now, suppose it goes against my sensibilities in some respects to include 
a ball in the <b>balls</b> map once its number of balls reaches zero.  
When that happens, I decide to remove it from the map, so that I'm not later
traversing a map whose elements I skip.  I may very well write code
as in 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-2.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-2.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
void BallsInBoxes::GenInstances(int index)
{
  int i;
  map &lt;string, int&gt;::iterator bit;

  if (index == boxes.size()) {
    cout &lt;&lt; boxes[0];
    for (i = 1; i &lt; boxes.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; boxes[i];
    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    return;
  }

  for (bit = balls.begin(); bit != balls.end(); bit++) {
    boxes[index] = bit-&gt;first;
    bit-&gt;second--;
    if (bit-&gt;second == 0) {
      balls.erase(bit);
      bit = balls.end();
    }
    GenInstances(index+1);  
    if (bit == balls.end()) {
      bit = balls.insert(make_pair(boxes[index], 1)).first;
    } else bit-&gt;second++;
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

When a ball's <b>second</b> field goes to zero, I remove it from the map and then
set <b>bit</b> to equal <b>balls.end()</b>.  After the recursion, if <b>bit</b> equals
<b>balls.end()</b>, then I re-insert the ball into the map.  Yes, that <b>balls.insert()</b>
call is ugly.  On a map, the <b>insert()</b> method returns a pair -- an iterator to the
element, and <b>true</b> if the element was actually inserted, or <b>false</b> if it was there
already.
<p>
Try this with six balls -- three colors, where <i>b<sub>i</sub></i> equals 2 for each of the
three balls:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>echo a a b b c c | bin/balls-in-boxes-2 </b></font>
a a b b c c
a a b c b c
a a b c c b
a a c b b c
a a c b c b
a a c c b b
....
</pre>

You'll see that it runs forever, and eventually you'll see lines like "a b a c a b".  Obviously,
we have a bug, since there should be two a's and two c's.  I'm not going to trace this
bug in detail, because it's too hard.  I'll simply tell you what's going on.   Look
at this snippet of the code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  for (bit = balls.begin(); bit != balls.end(); bit++) {
    boxes[index] = bit-&gt;first;
    bit-&gt;second--;
    if (bit-&gt;second == 0) {
      balls.erase(bit);
      bit = balls.end();
    }
    GenInstances(index+1);  
    if (bit == balls.end()) {
      bit = balls.insert(make_pair(boxes[index], 1)).first;
    } else bit-&gt;second++;
  }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The problem arises when you don't erase <b>bit</b> and then you make the
recursive call.  Suppose that <b>bit</b> points to the entry for "a" in the map.
Later, in the recursion, you're going to delete the entry for "a", because it's 
<b>second</b> field will be zero.  When all the recursion returns, <b>bit</b> is
pointing to an erased iterator.  I wish we got a seg fault when we incremented <b>bit->second</b>.
However, what happens is that the C++ runtime system reuses memory, and <b>bit</b> is pointing
to a valid iterator, which may no longer be for "a".  
<p>
This is a brutal bug, but one that can happen when you store iterators that may become
deleted.  It is similar to storing a pointer which is subsequently <b>free()'d</b> or <b>deleted</b>.
I've fixed this in 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-3.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-3.cpp</a></b>, although I'm not proud
of it.  Here's the relevant code snippet.  After the recursive call, I make sure that
<b>bit</b> points to the proper iterator:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  for (bit = balls.begin(); bit != balls.end(); bit++) {
    boxes[index] = bit-&gt;first;
    bit-&gt;second--;
    if (bit-&gt;second == 0) {
      balls.erase(bit);
      bit = balls.end();
    }
    GenInstances(index+1);  
    if (bit == balls.end()) {
      bit = balls.insert(make_pair(boxes[index], 1)).first;
    } else {
      bit = balls.find(boxes[index]);
      bit-&gt;second++;
    }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I think the code for 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-1.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-1.cpp</a></b>
is far superior to the others.  On the flip side, I don't think it's the best
way to solve this.  We should use a vector instead of a map; however, I don't
think that it's worth the class or study time to go through that level of detail.

<h3>Removing Recursion</h3>

I had mentioned in class that you can always remove recursion and model it with
a stack.  While the ensuing program may now not be recursive, it's usually a lot
more convoluted.  I'll give an example with
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-4.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-4.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class BallsInBoxes {
  public:
    map &lt;string,int&gt; balls;
    vector &lt;string&gt; colors;
    vector &lt;int&gt; nballs;
    vector &lt;string&gt; boxes;
    void GenInstances();
};

void BallsInBoxes::GenInstances()
{
  stack &lt;int&gt; Stack;
  int index, color, i;

  Stack.push(-1);

  while (!Stack.empty()) {
    color = Stack.top();
    Stack.pop();
    index = Stack.size();

    <font color=blue>// Base case -- if we're at the end of boxes, print it out and "return"</font>

    if (index == boxes.size()) {
      cout &lt;&lt; boxes[0];
      for (i = 1; i &lt; boxes.size(); i++) cout &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; boxes[i];
      cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    } else {

      if (color != -1) {  <font color=blue>// We have just finished enumerating with "color"</font>
        nballs[color]++;  
      }

      <font color=blue>// Find the next color to enumerate.  </font>
      <font color=blue>// Note how this works when color started at -1.</font>

      for (color++; color &lt; nballs.size() && nballs[color] == 0; color++) ;
    
      <font color=blue>// If we still have a color to enumerate, put it into boxes, push</font>
      <font color=blue>// the color onto the stack, and push -1 on the stack to enumerate the next index.</font>

      if (color &lt; nballs.size()) {
        boxes[index] = colors[color];
        nballs[color]--;
        Stack.push(color);
        Stack.push(-1);
      }
    }
  }
}

int main()
{
  BallsInBoxes B;
  map &lt;string, int&gt;::iterator bit;
  string s;
  int nb;

  while (cin &gt;&gt; s) B.balls[s]++; 

  nb = 0;
  for (bit = B.balls.begin(); bit != B.balls.end(); bit++) {
    B.colors.push_back(bit-&gt;first);
    B.nballs.push_back(bit-&gt;second);
    nb += bit-&gt;second;
  }

  B.boxes.resize(nb);
  
  B.GenInstances();
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

To make life easier, I've created the vectors <b>colors</b> and <b>nballs</b>. In 
this way, we can manage a stack of indices into the <b>colors</b> vector, which
is less confusing than maintaining a stack of iterators of <b>balls</b> (I have
that code in 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-5.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-5.cpp</a></b>).
<p>
Concentrate on <b>GenInstances()</b>.  It maintains a stack of indices of <b>colors</b>.
Instead of making recursive calls, you push -1 on the stack.  That's what we do
initially.  The stack contains indices of if the colors that we're currently enumerating.
Thus, the top of the stack is the color that we're enumerating in <b>boxes[Stack.size()-1]</b>.
Our main processing loop therefore removes this element from the top of the stack and
sets <b>index</b> to the new <b>Stack.size()</b>.  
<p>
If that element is -1, then we're starting a new enumeration.  If that element is
something else, then we've just finished enumerating that element.  So we increment
<b>nballs</b> to put that color back when we enumerate a new color.  In either case,
we now need to find the next color to enumerate, which is done by the <b>for</b> loop:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
for (color++; color &lt; nballs.size() && nballs[color] == 0; color++) ;
</pre></td></table></center><p>

If, after executing this <b>for</b> loop, <b>color</b> is equal to <b>nballs.size()</b>,
then we're done enumerating this index.  Otherwise, we need to enumerate the next
color, which we do with the following code:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
boxes[index] = colors[color];
nballs[color]--;
Stack.push(color);
Stack.push(-1);
</pre></td></table></center><p>

In this way, we mimic the recursive version of the program, only instead of
actually performing recursion, we simply manage the stack.  As always, if you
are confused by this, copy it, put in some print statements, and trace it.
Frankly, I think that the recursive version of this is <i>much</i> easier to
both read and write, but this is a good exercise in seeing how a stack can
replace recursion.

<p>
A final piece of code is in 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-5.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-5.cpp</a></b>.  This code also
manages a stack, but instead of managing integers, it manages iterator to <b>balls</b>.
Where -1 was in the code previously, we use <b>balls.end()</b>.  Try to trace through
it -- it is very similar to 
<b><a href=src/balls-in-boxes-4.cpp>src/balls-in-boxes-4.cpp</a></b>, except you need
to be unafraid of iterators!
