<h3>Disjoint Sets Clicker Questions, Set 1</h3>

Behold the following instance of disjoint sets (you can click on it to blow it up):

<p><center><table border=3><td><a href=img/C1.jpg><img src=img/C1.jpg width=1000></a></td></table></center><p>

Links go from low to high.

<OL>
<LI> How many disjoint sets are there?
<LI> If I say <b>Union(46,9)</b> why will there be an error?
<LI> If I'm using Union-by-size, and I call <b>Union(90,52)</b>, what link will change?
<LI> If I'm using Union-by-height, and I call <b>Union(90,52)</b>, what link will change?
<LI> If I'm using Union-by-rank-with-path-compression, how many links change when I call <b>Find(8)</b>  (look at the nodes on the bottom of the figure)?
<LI> If I'm using Union-by-rank-with-path-compression, how is it possible that <b>Ranks[128]</b>
     could be three?
