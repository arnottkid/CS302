<h3>Overview, and the Disjoint Set API</h3>

The Wikipedia page indexed above gives a pretty thorough treatment of Disjoint Sets.  However,
like most Wikipedia pages, it gives way too much information.  So, I'll summarize here.
<p>
The Disjoint Set data structure solves a specific problem that is interesting both theoretically 
and practically.  The problem is as follows:
<p>
You have a collection of <i>n</i> items, which you number from 0 to
<i>n-1</i>.  These items will be partitioned into some number of
sets.  The sets are "disjoint" which means that no item belongs to
more than one set.  All items belong to some set though (hence the use
of the word "partition.").
<p>
There are two operations that you can perform:
<UL>
<LI> <i>int Find(i):</i> This takes the number of an item and returns its "set id."  This is
a number between zero and <i>n-1</i>.  You don't really care what the number is; however, if
<i>i</i> and <i>j</i> belong to the same disjoint set, then 
<i>Find(i)</i> will equal <i>Find(j)</i>.
<p>
<LI> <i>int Union(id1, id2)</i>: This takes the set id's of two different sets, and performs
the union operation on them, coalescing them into one set.  It returns the set id of this
new set.  Now, when you call <i>Find()</i> on any item that was previously in either of these
sets, it will return this new set id.
</UL>
To initialize an instance of disjoint sets, you start with <i>n</i> items, each of
which is in its own disjoint set, whose set id equals the element's number.  
You make <i>Union()</i> calls to start coalescing sets.
<p>
Disjoint sets are very useful in connected component applications.  They are also <i>extremely</i>
efficient (we'll talk about that later).

<hr>
<h3>Abstract implementation</h3>

In the abstract, we implement disjoint sets with circles and arrows, which we'll call
"nodes" and links.  Each element will be in its own node, and each element has one link.
That link is either to another node, or to NULL.  In the beginning, when you first set
up an instance of disjoint setes, all nodes will have NULL links.
<p>
When a node has a NULL link, we call it the "root" of a set.  If you call <i>Find()</i> on 
a node with a NULL link, it will return the node's item number, and that is the set id of
the node.   Therefore, when you first start, every node is the root of its own set, and when
you call <i>Find(i)</i>, it will return <i>i</i>.
<p>
When you call <i>Union(i, j)</i>, remember that <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> must be set id's.
Therefore, they must be nodes with NULL links.  What you do is have one of those nodes set
its link to the other node.  
<p>
Let's illustrate with a simple example.  We initialize an instance of disjoint sets with 
10 items.  Each item is a node with a number from 0 to 9.  Each node has a NULL link, which 
we depict by not drawing any arrows from the node:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/P1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Again, each node is in its own set, and each node's set id is its number.  Suppose we call
<i>Union(0, 1)</i>, 
<i>Union(2, 3)</i> and 
<i>Union(4, 5)</i>.  These will each set one of the node's link to the other node.  We'll talk
about how that gets done later.  However, suppose this is the result:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/P2.jpg></td></table></center><p>

As you can see, node 0's link has been set to 1.  Both of these nodes' set ids are now 1, which 
means <i>Find(0)</i> equals <i>Find(1)</i> equals one.  Similarly, 
<i>Find(2)</i> equals <i>Find(3)</i> equals three. 
<p>
This gives you a clue about implementing <i>Find()</i>.  When you call <i>Find(n)</i>, what you do
is keep setting <i>n</i> to <i>n</i>'s link, until <i>n</i>'s link is NULL.  At that point, you 
are at the root of the set, and you return <i>n</i>.
<p>
Union is pretty simple, too, but you have some choices about how to determine which node sets
its link field to the other.  We use three methods to do this:
<OL>
<LI> <b>Union by size</b>: Make the node whose set size is smaller point to the node whose set size is bigger.  Break ties arbitrarily.
<LI> <b>Union by height</b>: The height of a set is the longest number of links that it takes
to get from one of its items to the root.  With union by height, you make the 
node whose height is smaller point to the node whose height is bigger.
<LI> <b>Union by rank with path compression</b>: 
This works exactly like union by height, except you don't really know the height of the
set.  Instead, you use the set's rank, which is what its height would be, were you using 
union by height.  The reason that you don't know the height is that when you call <i>Find(i)</i>
on an element, you perform "path compression."  What this does is set the link of all non-root
nodes from the path from i to the root, to the root.  
<p>
As always, a picture helps.  Suppose this is the state of our disjoint set instance:

<center><table border=3><td><img src=img/P8.jpg></td></table></center><p>

There are two sets, with set id's 5 and 9.  Now, suppose you call <i>Find(0)</i>.  It will 
return five, but along the way to the root node of its set, it encounters nodes 1 and 3.
Before returning five, it sets the links to 0, 1 and 3 to five:

<center><table border=3><td><img src=img/P9.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Do you see why this is a good thing?  Previously, when you called <i>Find(0)</i>, you needed to
travel through nodes 1 and 3 before getting to 5.  If you call <i>Find(0)</i> again, you get to
node 5 directly.  Similarly, you have improved the performance of <i>Find(1)</i>, and <i>Find(2)</i>.
<p>
You can see that path compression has altered the height of the set.  However, we maintain
what its height would be, had we not used path compression, and call it the set's <i>rank.</i>
We use the rank to determine how we perform union.
</OL>

<h3>Running Times</h3>

We assume the number of items in the instance of disjoint sets is <i>n</i>:
<UL>
<LI> Initializing an instance of disjoint sets: <i>O(n)</i>
<LI> Performing <i>Union()</i> in any of the implementations: <i>O(1)</i>
<LI> Performing <i>Find()</i> in Union by size or height: <i>O(log(n))</i>
<LI> Performing <i>Find()</i> in Union by rank with path compression: <i>O(&alpha;(n))</i>,
where 
<i>&alpha;(n)</i> is the inverse of Ackerman's function.  I'm not defining that here -- either
come to class or read 
<a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function>The Wikipedia Page</a>, especially 
the section entitled "Inverse."
In other words, while you cannot say that <i>Find()</i> is constant time, for all practical
purposes, it is.
</UL>

<hr>
<h3>Implementation in C++</h3>

The API for disjoint sets is pretty minimal.  In C++, I use an 
<a href=http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/Interfaces/>Interface</a>
to define the class,
because I am going to have three separate implementations.  Each one of those is in its
own subclass.

<UL>
<LI> A constructor takes the number of elements in the set.  Each element starts off in its own 
set, whose set id equals the element.
<p>
<LI> The <b>Find(e)</b> operator returns the set id for element <i>e</i>.  This can be any integer.
However, if two elements are in the same set, than calling <b>Find()</b> on them will yield the same
result.  
<p>
<LI> The <b>Union(s1, s2)</b> operator takes two set ids, and merges all elements in the two sets so
that they are in one set.  It returns the set id of the new set.  Calling <b>Find()</b> on any element
in the newly merged set will return this set id.
<p>
<LI> <b>Print()</b>: This shows the internal state of the data structure.
</UL>

The API is in 
<b><a href=include/disjoint.hpp>include/disjoint.hpp</a></b>:

class DisjointSetByHeight : public DisjointSet {
  public:

    int Union(int s1, int s2);
    int Find(int element);

    std::vector &lt;int&gt; ranks;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Each subclass has a <b>links</b> vector that holds the parent pointers for each
element.  If <b>links[e]</b> is equal to negative one, then <b>e</b>
is the root and set id of the set.  If <b>links[e]</b> does not equal
-1, then the set id of <b>e</b> is equal to the set id of
<b>links[e]</b>.
<p>
Each subclass, however, has a different vector to store the sizes/heights/ranks:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> If we're implementing union-by-size, then if <b>e</b> is the root of a set, <b>sizes[e]</b> holds
the number of elements of that set. 
<LI> If we're implementing union-by-height, then if <b>e</b> is the root of a set, <b>heights[e]</b> holds
the number of elements in the longest path in the set. 
<LI> If we're implementing union-by-rank, then <b>ranks</b> holds the same information as in union-by-height,
with the understanding that there may not be a path with that many elements due to path compression.
</UL>
<p>
In all cases, if <b>e</b> is not the root of a set,
<b>sizes[e]/heights[e]/ranks[e]</b> is immaterial.
<p>
Each subclass is implemented in its own source file:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> <b><a href=src/disjoint-size.cpp>src/disjoint-size.cpp</a></b> implements union-by-size.
<LI> <b><a href=src/disjoint-height.cpp>src/disjoint-height.cpp</a></b> implements union-by-height.
<LI> <b><a href=src/disjoint-rank.cpp>src/disjoint-rank.cpp</a></b> implements union-by-rank with path compression.
</UL>
I will start with union-by-size, and then show the differences with the others.  The differences
are <i>very</i> minor.
<p>
The constructor sets up the two vectors.  Each element is in its own set, so all links are -1 and all sizes are 1.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
DisjointSetBySize::DisjointSetBySize(int nelements)
{
  links.resize(nelements, -1);
  sizes.resize(nelements, 1);
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>Find(e)</b> operator chases <b>link[e]</b> until it equals -1:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Disjoint::Find(int element)
{
  while (links[element] != -1) element = links[element];
  return element;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And the <b>Union(s1, s2)</b> operator first checks to make sure that the set id's are
valid, and then chooses a parent and a child from <b>s1</b> and <b>s2</b>.  The parent
will be the one with the bigger of the two sets.  It changes the link field of the 
child to point to the parent, and then it updates the size of the parent in the <b>sizes</b>
vector:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Disjoint::Union(int s1, int s2)
{
  int p, c;

  if (links[s1] != -1 || links[s2] != -1) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "Must call union on a set, and not just an element.\n";
    exit(1);
  }
  if (sizes[s1] &gt; sizes[s2]) {
    p = s1;
    c = s2;
  } else {
    p = s2;
    c = s1;
  }
  links[c] = p;
  sizes[p] += sizes[c];    <b>/* HERE */</b>
  return p;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I won't show <b>Print()</b>. It simply prints out the vectors.  
<p>
The only difference between union-by-size and union-by-height is that <b>heights</b> keeps track of the 
number of nodes in the longest path.  After changing all of the "sizes" to "heights", 
it is a one line change to union-by-size -- the line marked
<b>HERE</b> is changed to:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  if (heights[s1] == heights[s2]) heights[p]++; 
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This is because a set's height only changes if the two sets being merged have equal heights.
<p>
Finally, union-by-rank is equivalent to union-by-height, except that you perform path 
compression on find operations.  With path compression, each time you perform a <b>Find(e)</b>
operation, you update the <b>links</b> field of all elements on the path to the root, so that
they equal the root.  Here's one way to do this:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Disjoint::Find(int element)
{
  vector &lt;int&gt; q;
  int i;

  while (links[element] != -1) {
    q.push_back(element);
    element = links[element];
  }
  for (i = 0; i &lt; q.size(); i++) links[q[i]] = element;
  return element;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

This is one of those convenient things about the STL -- I don't have to call <b>new</b>
or <b>delete</b>.  When the <b>Find()</b> operation is over, the vector is deallocated.
<p>
However, I could implement path compression in two other ways, and it's illustrative to
go over them.  The first is with simple recursion:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Disjoint::Find(int element)
{
  if (links[element] == -1) return element;
  links[element] = Find(links[element]);
  return links[element];
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The second is to traverse <b>links</b> to the root, but while doing so, setting
<b>links[element]</b> to be <b>element</b>'s child.  In that way, once you find
the root, you can use <b>links</b> to go back to the original element, performing
path compression along the way.  The code is here -- if you're a little leery of 
this code, copy it to your directory and put in some print statements.  This should be 
the best implementation performance-wise, because it doesn't use extra memory like the other two.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int Disjoint::Find(int e)
{
  int p, c;   <font color=blue>// P is the parent, c is the child.</font>
  c = -1;

  <font color=blue>/* Find the root of the tree, but along the way, set
     the parents' links to the children. */</font>

  c = -1;
  while (links[e] != -1) {
    p = links[e];
    links[e] = c;
    c = e;
    e = p;
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Now, travel back to the original element, setting
     every link to the root of the tree. */</font>

  p = e;
  e = c;
  while (e != -1) {
    c = links[e];
    links[e] = p;
    e =c;
  }
  return p;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<h3>Example of Use</h3>

The program <b><a href=src/example.cpp>src/example.cpp</a></b> 
shows a simple example of using the
API.  It does the operations in the example above, which is nice because it illustrates
the difference between the three algorithms.  First, let's take a look at how it
uses a command line argument to select which subclass it will use:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  DisjointSet *d;
  string arg;

  int s01, s23, s45;
  int s0123, s456, s4567, s45678;
  int s012345678;

  <font color=blue>/* Error check the command line. */</font>
  arg = "";
  if (argc == 2) arg = argv[1];

  if (arg != "size" && arg != "height" && arg != "rank") {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: example size|height|rank\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Create the DisjointSet pointer using the proper subclass constructor. */</font>
  switch(arg[0]) {
    case 's': d = new DisjointSetBySize(10); break;
    case 'h': d = new DisjointSetByHeight(10); break;
    case 'r': d = new DisjointSetByRankWPC(10); break;
    default: exit(1);
  }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

As for the rest, I'm just going to show the Union and Find commands, so that you can see what
it's doing without all of the prints:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  s01 = d-&gt;Union(0, 1); 
  s23 = d-&gt;Union(2, 3); 
  s45 = d-&gt;Union(4, 5); 
  d-&gt;Print();

  print d-&gt;Find(0) and d-&gt;Find(1));

  s0123 = d-&gt;Union(s01, s23); 
  s456 = d-&gt;Union(s45, 6); 
  s4567 = d-&gt;Union(s456, 7); 
  s45678 = d-&gt;Union(s4567, 8); 


  print d-&gt;Find(1);
  print d-&gt;Find(2);
  print d-&gt;Find(4);
  print d-&gt;Find(7);
  d-&gt;Print();

  s012345678 = d-&gt;Union(s0123, s45678); 
  d-&gt;Print();

  print d-&gt;Find(3);
  print d-&gt;Find(5);
  print d-&gt;Find(7);
  d-&gt;Print();

  print d-&gt;Find(0);
  d-&gt;Print();
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

</pre>


We first run it with union-by-size.  Let's look at the output incrementally.  When 
the program starts, it sets up an empty <b>Disjoint</b> with ten elements:

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>binexample size</b></font>
Starting State:

Node:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Links:  -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
Sizes:   1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=center align=center><IMG src=img/P1.jpg></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>
Next, it performs three union operations: 
<b>Union(0, 1)</b>,
<b>Union(2, 3)</b>, and
<b>Union(4, 5)</b>.  Since each set in all three operations is the same size, the choice
of parent and child is arbitrary.  Here's the output and how it looks pictorally (I've
added the sizes to the roots of each set):

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<pre>
Doing d->Union(0, 1).  Resulting set = 1
Doing d->Union(2, 3).  Resulting set = 3
Doing d->Union(4, 5).  Resulting set = 5

Node:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Links:   1 -1  3 -1  5 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
Sizes:   1  2  1  2  1  2  1  1  1  1
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=center align=center><IMG src=img/P2.jpg></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

Next it performs four more union operations: 
<b>Union(1, 3)</b>,
<b>Union(5, 6)</b>, 
<b>Union(5, 7)</b>, and
<b>Union(5, 8)</b>.  The first union operation merges two sets of the same
size, so the parent/child selection is arbitrary.  The remaining three
union operations merge sets of size 1 (sets 6, 7 and 8) with set 5 which 
is larger.  Thus, in each case, set 5 becomes the parent.  The resulting
sets are pictured to the right.  
<p>
The <b>Find()</b> operations return the root of each set -- three in the 
set {0, 1, 2, 3}, and five in the set {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.
<p>
You should make sure that you understand how the output of the program
maps to the picture.  In particular, make sure you understand the <b>Links</b>
and <b>Ranks</b> lines and what they mean.

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<pre>
Doing d->Union(1, 3).  Resulting set = 3
Doing d->Union(5, 6).  Resulting set = 5
Doing d->Union(5, 7).  Resulting set = 5
Doing d->Union(5, 8).  Resulting set = 5
d->Find(1) = 3
d->Find(2) = 3
d->Find(4) = 5
d->Find(7) = 5

Node:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Links:   1  3  3 -1  5 -1  5  5  5 -1
Sizes:   1  2  1  4  1  5  1  1  1  1
</pre>
</td> 
<td valign=center align=center><IMG src=img/P3.jpg></td>
</tr> 
</table></center><p>  

Now, we perform <b>Union(3, 5)</b>.  Since set 5 has more elements than
set 3, it is the parent and 3 is the child.  Subsequent <b>Find()</b>
operations on 3, 5, 7 and 0 all return 5 as the set id:

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top>
<pre>

Although the trees look the same, the <b>heights</b> fields are different
from the previous <b>size</b> fields.  So, when we perform the last union of 3 and 
5, 3 becomes the parent, since
it has greater height.  Subsequent <b>Find()</b> operations all return 3 now:

Lastly, with path compression (union-by-rank), all the output is the same until those last <b>Find()</b> operations.
We'll start with the last Union, where the state of the data structure is the same as above:

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top><pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>bin/example rank</b></font>
....
....
Doing d->Union(3, 5).  Resulting set = 3

Node:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Links:   1  3  3 -1  5  3  5  5  5 -1

</pre>
</td>
<td valign=center align=center><IMG src=img/P4H.jpg></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

When we perform the three <b>Find()</b> operations, the last one -- <b>Find(7)</b> 
performs path compression, setting node 7's <b>link</b> to the root of the set: 3:


<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top><pre>
d->Find(3) = 3
d->Find(5) = 3
d->Find(7) = 3

Node:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Links:   1  3  3 -1  5  3  5  3  5 -1
Ranks:   1  2  1  3  1  2  1  1  1  1
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=center align=center><IMG src=img/P5.jpg></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

Similarly, the last <b>Find(0)</b> operation also performs path compression:

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top><pre>
d->Find(0) = 3

Node:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Links:   3  3  3 -1  5  3  5  3  5 -1
Ranks:   1  2  1  3  1  2  1  1  1  1
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=center align=center><IMG src=img/P6.jpg></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

Were we to call 
<b>Find(4)</b>
<b>Find(6)</b> and 
<b>Find(8)</b>, then those nodes too would perform path compression and point directly 
to node three.  In that case, the state would be the following:

<p><center>
<table cellpadding=3 border=3>
<tr>
<td valign=top><pre>
d.Find(4) = 3
d.Find(6) = 3
d.Find(8) = 3

Node:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
Links:  3  3  3 -1  3  3  3  3  3 -1
Ranks:  1  2  1  3  1  2  1  1  1  1
</pre>
</td>
<td valign=center align=center><IMG src=img/P7.jpg></td>
</tr>
</table></center><p>

I draw this picture because you should see that <b>ranks[3]</b> remains at three, even though its
height is two.  This is because the <b>ranks</b> field traces what the height of the tree would
be with no path compression.  We can't keep it updated properly without adding to the running time
of the <b>Union()</b> or <b>Find()</b> operations.  Fortunately, it doesn't matter -- the fine
theoreticians of the world have proved that <b>Find()</b>
operations run in <i>O(&alpha;(n))</i> time.  <b>Union()</b> operations are still <i>O(1)</i>.

<h3>Maze Generation Program with Disjoint Sets</h3>

Generating mazes is a neat application of Disjoint Sets.  A maze, like the one pictured below, may be
viewed as an undirected graph, where each cell in a grid is a node in the graph, and if one can move
horizontally or vertically from one cell to the next, there is an edge between the nodes.  If there
is a wall between two cells, then there is no edge.

<p><center><table border=0><td><IMG src=img/maze.jpg></table></center><p>

A good maze is one where the graph is fully connected, so that every cell is reachable from the
start/end cells, but there are no cycles.  We can generate such a maze using disjoint sets.
We start with a completely disconnected graph, where each cell is surrounded by walls.  
If this graph has <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns, then the graph contains <i>r*c</i> 
nodes and no edges.    
<p>
What we'll do is choose a random wall to remove.  If that wall separates nodes in different
connected components, then we'll remove it, thereby lowering the number of connected components.
If it doesn't separate nodes in different connected components, we keep it.
<p>
This can be done with disjoint sets.  We start with each cell in its own set, and then we choose
a random wall.  If that wall connects two nodes in different sets, we remove the wall and
call <b>Union()</b> on the two sets.  Otherwise, we keep the wall.  We keep doing this until
we have just one set.
<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href=src/maze-gen.cpp>src/maze-gen.cpp</a></b>.  It's a little tricky.  We first generate
all the walls.  Walls that separate vertically adjacent cells are indexed by the smaller
cell number.  Walls
that separate horizontally adjacent cells are indexed by the smaller cell number plus <i>r*c</i>.
We generate all the walls and insert them into a multiset keyed by a random number.  Then we 
traverse the multiset, deleting walls if they separate different components, until we have
just one component.  Then we print out the walls:

When I compile this with <b>DJ-rank.cpp</b> and run it, the first lines are:

Elts:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7

Draw the data structure (as circles and pointers) just before the <b>d.Find()</b> call.
Then give me the output of the last <b>d.Print()</b> call.

<h3>Answer</h3>

You use the <b>links</b> field to draw the data structure:

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/EE1.jpg></td></table></center><p>

When you call <b>d.Find(0)</b>, path compression occurs, which means that
nodes 0, 1 (and 3) all point to the root (7): 

<p><center><table border=3><td><img src=img/EE2.jpg></td></table></center><p>

Thus, the <b>links</b> fields for 0 and 1 will become 7.  Everything else
remains the same, because <b>Find()</b> doesn't change the <b>ranks</b>. 
So the output is:

<pre>
Elts:   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
Links:  7  7  3  7  5  7  7 -1
Ranks:  1  2  1  3  1  2  1  4
</pre>
