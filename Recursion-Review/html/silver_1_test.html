We can satisfy 90 silver with 10 gold.  Returning 10.

We want:  G2:   0   S2:   0   B2: 810

Our bronze deficit is 810 and we need 90 silver.  Making a recursive call.

We have:  G1:  10   S1:   0   B1:   0
We want:  G2:   0   S2:  90   B2:   0

We can satisfy 90 silver with 10 gold.  Returning 10.

We recursively got 90 silver to convert to 810 gold.  RV=10.  Returning 10+90 = 100

100

We can satisfy 90 silver with 10 gold, but need to get more from bronze recursively.
