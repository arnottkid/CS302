<h2>Introduction</h2>

Inheritance and interfaces are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented
programming.  If it's not well-known to you that I don't like them,
it will be soon.  However, they have their place in the universe of programming,
whether I like it or not, so I'll give you some discourse on the topic.  I will
white my detailed opinions at the end of this document, but I will summarize them
here:

Inheritance and interfaces are very powerful organizational tools for programming.
You can do a lot of things with them that you cannot do easily without them.  On the flip
side, they introduce intricate sources of bugs and confusion that you avoid by not using
them, and worse yet, over time, a bad decision about inheritance/interfaces can make your
code convoluted, inefficient, and incorrect.  
Therefore, if you do decide to contaminate your code with interfaces, or worse
yet, inheritance, keep it to a minimum, and <b><i>document your decisions cleanly and thoroughly</i></b>.
I cannot stress this enough.

<h2>A Motivating Example Without Inheritance or Interfaces</h2>

You've decided to take your knitting to the next level, so you open an Etsy store.
You don't want to "Penny Blossom" yourself, so you decide to start with just two 
items: dog sweaters and monogrammed Koozies.  
They have the following attributes that you'd like to 
keep track of in your bookkeeping:

<p>
<center>
<table border=3 cellpadding=10>
<td valign=top>
<b>Koozies</b>:
<UL>
<LI> Color (string - custom)
<LI> Monogram (string - custom)
<LI> Yards of yarn (double - this is a constant: 1.5)
<LI> Selling Price: $10.00.
</UL>
</pre>
</td><td valign=top>
<b>Dog Sweaters</b>:
<UL>
<LI> Color (string - custom)
<LI> Size (S|L)
<LI> Yards of yarn (double: 3 for small, 6 for large)
<LI> Selling Price ($20 for small, $40 for large).
</UL>
</td>
</table>
</center>
<p>

You are keeping track of your sales in text files, one file for sale.  Your
files have the following format:
<p>
<UL>
<LI> The first line is the customer's name.
<LI> The remaining lines are in one of two formats:
<pre>
"Koozie" color monogram
"Dog" color S|L
</pre>
</UL>

Here are two example files:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3>
<td valign=top>
<b><a href=f1.txt>f1.txt</a></b>
<pre>
Isabelle Human
Koozie Red IH
Koozie Blue BH
Dog S Red
</pre></td>
<td valign=top>
<b><a href=f2.txt>f2.txt</a></b>
<pre>
Jonathan Cherubim
Dog L Orange
Dog S White
Koozie Orange JLC
Koozie White JXC
</pre></td>
</table></center><p>

You'd like to write a program that formats each sale nicely and reports your profits and
expenses.  Yarn is $2.25 a yard, and Etsy charges 8% fees on your gross.  Here's what you
have envisioned:

Let's write the program using vanilla C++.  
It's in <b><a href=make_invoice_1_normal.cpp>make_invoice_1_normal.cpp</a></b>.
We'll have a class for a Dog and a class for
a Koozie.  Here's the Dog class with standard Dr. Plank-style C++:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
class Dog {
  public:
    Dog(istringstream &ss);
    string Description();
    double Price();
    double Expenses();
  protected:
    string color;
    string size;
    double yards;
    double price;
};

Dog::Dog(istringstream &ss)
{
  ss &gt;&gt; size &gt;&gt; color;

  if (size == "S") {
    yards = 3.0;
    price = 20.0;
  } else if (size == "L") {
    yards = 6.0;
    price = 20.0;
  } else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Bad dog size: %s\n", size.c_str());
    exit(1);
  }
}
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
string Dog::Description()
{
  string s;
 
  s = (size == "S") ? "Small " : "Large ";
  s += color;
  s += " Dog Sweater";
  return s;
}

double Dog::Price()
{
  return price;
}

double Dog::Expenses()
{
  return yards * 2.25;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

I've written the definition for the Koozie class in a different style
-- here we implement the code in the class definition and specify
default values in the constructor specification.  You may prefer this
style, and while I acknowledge the simplicity of the specifications
of <b>Price()</b> and <b>Expenses()</b>, I still don't like it.  I
like to have defintions and implementations separated.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Koozie {
  protected:
    string color;
    string monogram;
    double yards;
    double price;
  public:
    Koozie(istringstream &ss) : 
       yards(1.5), 
       price(10.0) 
       { ss &gt;&gt; color &gt;&gt; monogram; };
    string Description() {
      string s;
      s = color + " Koozie with monogram ";
      s += monogram; 
      return s;
    }
    double Price() { return price; }
    double Expenses() { return yards * 2.25; }
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

The <b>main()</b> code is really straightforward.  When it's reading the items, it reads
the first word on the line and decides whether to create an instance of <b>Dog</b> or 
<b>Koozie</b>.  I'm going to highlight some lines in this code that feel like they are more
clunky and inefficient than they should be:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td valign=top><pre>
int main()
{
  istringstream ss;
  string name;
  string line;
  string key;
  Dog *d;
  Koozie *k;
  string desc;    <font color=blue>// Description of an item.</font>
  double p;       <font color=blue>// Price of an item.</font>
  double e;       <font color=blue>// Expenses of an item.</font>
  double tp;      <font color=blue>// Running total of prices.</font>
  double te;      <font color=blue>// Running total of expenses.</font>
  double fees;    <font color=blue>// Fees</font>

  <font color=blue>/* Read and print the customer name. */</font>

  getline(cin, name);
  printf("Customer: %s\n", name.c_str());
  printf("\n");

  <font color=blue>/* Print labels for the items. */</font>

  printf("%-60s %6s %6s\n", "Description", "Price", "Costs");
</pre></td><td valign=top><pre>
  <font color=blue>/* Print each item -- description, price, expenses. 
     You'll note that there's some code duplication, 
     because Dog and Koozie are different classes.  */</font>

  tp = 0;
  te = 0;
  while (getline(cin, line)) {
    ss.clear();
    ss.str(line);
    ss &gt;&gt; key;
    if (key == "Koozie") {
      k = new Koozie(ss);
      desc = k-&gt;Description();    <font color=blue>// These three lines</font>
      p = k-&gt;Price();             <font color=blue>// feel</font>
      e = k-&gt;Expenses();          <font color=blue>// redundant.</font>
      delete k;
    } else if (key == "Dog") {
      d = new Dog(ss);
      desc = d-&gt;Description();    <font color=blue>// With these</font>
      p = d-&gt;Price();             <font color=blue>// three</font>
      e = d-&gt;Expenses();          <font color=blue>// lines.</font>
      delete d;
    }
    tp += p;
    te += e;
    printf("%-60s %6.2lf %6.2lf\n", desc.c_str(), p, e);
  }

  <font color=blue>/* Print the final information. */</font>

  printf("\n");
  fees = tp * 0.08;
  printf("Gross:  %8.2lf\n", tp);
  printf("Costs:  %8.2lf\n", te);
  printf("Fees:   %8.2lf\n", fees);
  printf("Profit: %8.2lf\n", tp - te - fees);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

<h3>Leveraging commonality with an Interface</h3>

With C++, you can specify an <i>interface</i>.  This is a class that only contains "virtual"
methods.  In your specification, you label the methods with the <b>virtual</b> keyword, and 
set their values to zero.  I know that seems odd.  The "virtual" keyword is a placeholder,
saying that the method is going to implemented elsewhere, in another class (as you'll see).
Here's a specification of an interface for
an Item, which contains virtual methods for 
<b>Description()</b>, <b>Price()</b> and <b>Expenses()</b> (it also has a destructor -- more
on that later).  The code is in
<b><a href=make_invoice_2_interface.cpp>make_invoice_2_interface.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Item {
  public:
    virtual ~Item() {};
    virtual string Description() = 0;
    virtual double Price() = 0;
    virtual double Expenses() = 0;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

Our <b>Dog</b> and <b>Koozie</b> classes have no changes, except they specify that they 
implement the <b>Item</b> interface.  The changed code is in red.

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Dog <font color=red>: public Item</font> {
  public:
    Dog(istringstream &ss);
    string Description();
    double Price();
    double Expenses();
  protected:
    string color;
    string size;
    double yards;
    double price;
};
</pre></td><td><pre>
class Koozie <font color=red>: public Item</font> {
  public:
    Koozie(istringstream &ss);
    string Description();
    double Price();
    double Expenses();
  protected:
    string color;
    string monogram;
    double yards;
    double price;
};
</pre></td></table></center><p>

In the main code, we no longer declare the <b>Dog</b> or <b>Koozie</b> pointers.  Instead, 
we simply declare a pointer to an <b>Item</b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
int main()
{
  Item *i;           <font color=blue>// No longer do we have separate Dog / Koozie pointers.</font>
  istringstream ss;
  ...
</pre></td></table></center><p>

And then when we create an instance of <b>Dog</b> or <b>Koozie</b>, we assign the pointer 
to the <b>Item</b> pointer.  When we call the item's methods, it calls the appropriate
method of <b>Dog</b> or <b>Koozie</b>.  The code is simpler:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
  while (getline(cin, line)) {
    ss.clear();
    ss.str(line);
    ss &gt;&gt; key;
    if (key == "Koozie") {          <font color=blue>// Here is the relevant code.</font>
      i = new Koozie(ss);           <font color=blue>// Since Koozie/Dog implement the </font>
    } else if (key == "Dog") {      <font color=blue>// Item interface, we can treat </font>
      i = new Dog(ss);              <font color=blue>// them as items.</font>
    }
    desc = i-&gt;Description();        <font color=blue>// Now there is no code duplication.</font>
    p = i-&gt;Price();
    e = i-&gt;Expenses();
    delete i;

    tp += p;
    te += e;
    printf("%-60s %6.2lf %6.2lf\n", desc.c_str(), p, e);
  }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You need that destructor code in there to make deletion work.  In this case, it is
specifying that you can use a default destructor for the <b>Item</b>.  You will also 
use the default destructor for <b>Dog</b> and <b>Koozie</b>, since you have not specified
them.  See the last section of these lecture notes for some explanation on destructors.
<p>
I think you can see how this functionality is powerful, and in many cases can clean up your
code.

<h3>Drinking the Kool-Aid.  Moving from an Interface to Inheritance</h3>

I'm sure you've noticed that the <b>Dog</b> and <b>Koozie</b> classes have a lot more in
common than the specification of their methods.  In particular:

<UL>
<LI> They both have <b>color</b>, <b>yards</b> and <b>price</b> variables.
<LI> Their implementations of <b>Price()</b> and <b>Expenses()</b> are identical.
</UL>

Wouldn't it be nice if you could remove that duplication?  Enter inheritance.  What we're going
to do now is move the common elements up into the Item, and we'll remove the <b>virtual</b>
tag on <b>Price()</b> and <b>Expenses()</b>.  The code is in 
<b><a href=make_invoice_3_inheritance.cpp>make_invoice_3_inheritance.cpp</a></b>:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
class Item {
  public:
    virtual ~Item() {};
    virtual string Description() = 0;

    <font color=blue>// We have moved these variables and members into the class.</font>

    string color;
    double yards;
    double price;

    double Price();
    double Expenses();
};

<font color=blue>/* And we implement them here. */</font>

double Item::Price() { return price; }
double Item::Expenses() { return yards * 2.25; }
</pre></td></table></center><p>

We remove the common variables and member functions from <b>Dog</b> and <b>Koozie</b>.
Let's take a quick look at the <b>Dog</b> specification and constructor:

<p><center><table border=3 cellpadding=3><td><pre>
<font color=blue>/* Our Dog class now only has the items that are specific to it. */</font>

class Dog : public Item {
  public:
    Dog(istringstream &ss);
    string Description();
  protected:
    string size;
};

Dog::Dog(istringstream &ss)
{
  ss &gt;&gt; size &gt;&gt; color;

  if (size == "S") {
    yards = 3.0;
    price = 20.0;
  } else if (size == "L") {
    yards = 6.0;
    price = 20.0;
  } else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Bad dog size: %s\n", size.c_str());
    exit(1);
  }
}
</pre></td></table></center><p>

You'll notice that <b>Dog</b> can use the variables in <b>Item</b>, because it "inherits"
them.  That's pretty neat, isn't it?  And also pretty powerful.  If you want, you can create
a new class that inherits <b>Dog</b>, and now:

<UL>
<LI> That class will be able to use all of the member variables of both <b>Dog</b> and <b>Item</b>.
<LI> You can use a pointer to that class as a <b>Dog</b> or an <b>Item</b>.
</UL>

<h3>Reiterating the difference between an Interface and Inheritance</h3>

An interface is a restricted subset of inheritance.  With an interface you define
a class which will contain a bunch of subclasses.  The subclasses will each implement
methods that correspond to methods that the interface defines.  You'll note, the 
interface implements nothing -- it merely specifies the methods that each of the 
subclasses will implement.  An interface shouldn't contain variables, and it shouldn't
contain code.  It merely contains prototypes.
<p>
Inheritance on the other hand allows you to set up an arbitrarily complex hierarchy
of methods, variables and virtual methods.  The main class (superclass) contains 
all three of these things, and then any subclass that is <i>derived</i> from the superclass
"inherits" the methods and variables and may use them as if they belong to the superclass.
As above, a pointer to a subclass may be treated as a pointer to the superclass.
<p>
You'll note that C++ doesn't have a distinction between interface and inheritance.  You 
implement an interface when your superclass doesn't have any data or non-virtual methods.
<p>
There are many other issues involved with inheritance with respect to constructors, 
destructors, and public/protected/private designations.  I'm not going to teach you any
of that.  In this lecture, I simply wanted to let you know what an interface is, and
get your feet wet with inheritance.

<hr>
<h3>My opinions on Inheritance and Interfaces</h3>

Although I don't use them much, I like Interfaces, because they are pretty clean.  
They allow you to group classes by their functionality and then use a pointer to 
the grouping, rather than the individual classes.  That's nice.
<p>
Inheritance, on the other hand, is a powder keg.  Sure, it's very powerful, and you can 
eliminate redundancy as we did with the example above.  However, inheritance has two 
very strong negative features, the impact of which is probably not apparent when you first
start to learn the concepts:
<p>

<UL>
<LI> <b>Where are my variables and member functions defined?</b> 
When you're writing code, you can hold the code's structure in your head.  So, if you are
employing multiple levels of inheritance, you know where the pieces go.  Now, fast forward
three months when you need to fix a bug or modify your code, or god forbid, you have to 
read someone else's code.  For every variable, you have to find where the variable is 
declared and how it is used by the class that defined it, and all of the other subclasses
that inherit it.  IDE's can help you in this endeavor -- they can help you find the variables,
but they don't help with figuring out all of the interactions between the subclasses that
also inherit the variables.  This is a bigger issue than you think.
<p>
<LI> <b>What if my subclass doesn't really fit like a glove with my superclass or vice
versa?</b>  Think about the <b>color</b> variable above.  It's easy to envision a situation
where you decide to sell something new, like a potholder, which has two colors, and also has
a metal clip on it that is part of the expenses.  With the interface, you can add the <b>Potholder</b> class easly.  However, with the solution based on inheritance, 
when you pushed those variables and methods into the <b>Item</b>, you made it very difficult to
add the <b>Potholder</b> class.  You'll be tempted to do something to make the potholder work
within the current structure (like add a <b>color2</b> variable to the potholder, and to 
fudge its amount of yard so that the clip's price is reflected in the potholder's price.
But how is that going to look in three months?
</UL>

I cannot think of a time where I have seen a solution based on inheritance which wasn't 
convoluted and difficult to parse, and it's always because the objects get shoehorned into
an inheritance structure that doesn't really match real life.  Usually, it's because the 
structure was defined at time A, and new objects were added at time B, and the new objects didn't
fit the structure.  And it was way too hard to change the structure.  So you get illogical code
that's hard to read, and oh yeah, you have no idea where the variables are defined.  
<p>
For that reason, I don't use inheritance, and I advocate that you don't either.  I know it's
cool and seductive, but you'll regret it, most likely.  Of course, 
please make your own decisions in that regard.  I don't allow it in my classes.

<hr>
<h3>A little more on destructors</h3>

The proper way to handle destructors in interfaces is to make them virtual, both in the
superclass and in the subclass.  If you ignore the destructor 
in the subclass, then you'll simply use the
default destructor, just like with a regular class.  
<p>
If you do write destructors, what happens is as follows: When you delete a pointer, it will
call the proper subclass destructor first, and then the superclass destructor next.  (You can 
extrapolate this down the hierarchy if you are using a hierarchy of inheritance.  The following
code illustrates.  Simply read the inline comments to see what it does.  It is in
<b><a href=destruct.cpp>destruct.cpp</a></b>:
